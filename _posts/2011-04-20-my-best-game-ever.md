A nap certainly raises my efficiency levels. This was proved in the following game I played recently at [FICS](www.freechess.org). My opponent was a 2265, by far the strongest opponent I have faced so far in terms of ELO. But he didn‚Äôt play according to his rating I believe, although he did admit that I played well. Here‚Äôs my try at annotating the game, do feel free to comment on any move I didn‚Äôt see or anything that might have went wrong in my analysis of the game!

`1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6`

The Pirc defense is played against me for the first time. I don‚Äôt have any idea about this opening, apart from the fact that it was the opening played by Topalov in Kasparov‚Äôs Immortal game in 1999.

`3. Nc3 g6 4. Be3 Bg7 5. Qd2 O-O 6. O-O-O c6 7. Bh6`

Hoping to have an exchange of bishops and more importantly have the queen on `h6`, Black however has other ideas.

`7...Re8 8. f3`

Although I should have played this move before, it‚Äôs better late than never, avoiding Ng4 and sort of irritating Knight advances.

`8...Bh8 9. h4`

The purpose of the move is as is, to break open the kingside

`9...Be6`

I personally don‚Äôt like trapping my center pawns, so I thought I could take advantage of the fact that black is going to have a backward e pawn for now.

`10. Kb1 Na6 11. h5`

Continuing with the plan, I wasn‚Äôt too bothered by `Nb4`, but I could be wrong.

`11...Nb4 12. hxg6 fxg6 13. Nh3`

I did think about Bxh3, but then I was also imagining doubled rooks on the h-file which would need one less move after Rxh3. I was just trying to maintain the tempo and keep developing. In the actual game Bxh3 wasn‚Äôt played and I had the chance to play 

`13...Qa5 14. a3 Na6 15. Ng5`

Opens the dangerous a2-g8 diagonal for the white light-squared bishop after his black counterpart retreats.

`15...Bc8 16. Bc4+ e6 17. Qf4`

Bringing the Queen into the action and threatening Qxd6 with a strong attack

`17...Qc7 18. e5`

`17...Qc7` is a great move as it prevents any immediate offense on the 7th rank, I continue on opening lines towards the kingside.

`18...dxe5 19. dxe5 Nc5`
Another great move by black, he realises the importance of `e6`.

`20. Nce4`

Not `20. exf6???` which drops the queen. I thought for a long time before playing this move, I think it actually caused me a slight disadvantage even, but I was just trying to open the f-file for one of my Rooks if black played `Ncxe4` (as in the game). If not I had plans of `Nd6` and blocking the black queen access to e5, and subsequently the 7th rank.

`20...Nfxe4 21. fxe4`

As planned but now I am slightly forced on the backfoot.

`21...Bxe5`

I am down a pawn now! Of course my opponent is a 2200+!!

`22. Qf2`

Hoping to regain the lost pawn by means of a sham sacrifice.
`22...Qe7 23. Nxh7!`

Regains the pawn and further weakens the black kingside.

`23...Qxh7 24. Qxc5 Qc7 25. Rdf1`

Continuing with the original plan of Rooks on f and h files constraining the black kings‚Äô movement. Hence also the reason to play `Rdf1` rather than `Rhf1`.

`25...Qd6`

An exchange of queens now will give nothing for the position, with the material even and a higher rated opponent meaning a better endgame, one blunder and it‚Äôd be over for me, so I prefer to keep the Queens on board and continue with the attack.

`26. Qf2 Qe7`

Preventing `Qf7+` and mate in one. It‚Äôs amazing to see no blunders at all! All the more reasons for me to make none either!

`27. Bg5 Qg7 28. Qh4`

Here I‚Äôve seen a combination which will lead to a great advantage in material.

`28...b5 29. Bh6`

Trying to drive the Queen away.

`29...Qh7 30. Bb3 Bd7`

The combination I thought of earlier might be possible now, the black Queen is constrained by this move. But at the same time it connects the Rooks and lends to the defense of the 8-th rank.

`31. Qg5`

Attacking the black dark squared bishop, a very important piece in this game, `31...Qh8` loses to `32.Qxg6+`

`31...Bh8`

</center>

All parts of the puzzle are in place, the combination is in order, the assault begins..

`32. Bf8!!`

Exposing the black Queen..

`32...Rxf8`

And not `32...Qxh1??? 33. Qxg6+ Bg7 34.Qxg7` mate.

`33. Rxf8+ Rxf8 34. Rxh7 Rf1+`

An in between move, luckily the white king has a flight square.

`35. Ka2 Kxh7 36. Qe7+ Bg7 37. Qxd7`

Thus having a Queen for a Rook and a won endgame, but my history of blunders doesn‚Äôt permit me to take the ending lightly, fortunately I have not made any serious blunders as of now.

`37...Rg1 38. Qxe6 Re1`

And not `38...Rxg2??? 39. Qh3+` wins the Rook.

`39. Qxc6 Re3 40. Qb7 Re2 41. g4 Rg2 42. Be6`

I don‚Äôt know why I played that move, maybe I just want things to look nicer on the board, like having pawns on the same color as the bishop that I have, this drops a pawn however, but I am so far ahead in material that it hardly matters.
`42...Rxc2 43. Qxb5 Rxb2+ 44. Qxb2 Bxb2 45. Kxb2`
I give up the Queen for the last of blacks‚Äô pieces.
`45...Kg7 46. Kc3 Kf6 47. Bc8 Ke5 48. Kc4`
Here I thought it better (easier?) to Queen the a-pawn rather than the passed pawn (yes I am strange) because it‚Äôs easier to keep the opposition (also the fact that my king is closer to the a-file than blacks‚Äô)

`48...Kxe4 49. Kb5 Kd4 50. a4 Kc3 51. a5 Kb3 52. a6`

Now both pawns are protected by the bishop and the black pawns cannot move. Black‚Äôs king cannot defend his own pawns.

`52...Kc3 53. Kc6 1-0`

Black resigns.

### Comments

- **Anubhaw Srivastav** (on April 20, 2011) : Awesome game play.. just analyzed the game with the help of engine, couldn‚Äôt find a single weakness in your game. Letting your dark bishop to settle down there was a bad idea .. should have exchanged ..

- **Ritwick Saikia** (on July 13, 2011) : Well, that was interesting and I don‚Äôt even know the game. Congrats Himangshu on a game well played. What‚Äôs your ELO rating btw?

- **Himangshu Saikia** (on July 14, 2011) : @Ritwick : I can‚Äôt really say for sure üôÇ It‚Äôs somewhat between 1700-1800 in FICS standard time games. But I don‚Äôt know how that rating compares to official FIDE ratings. And well, I don‚Äôt play chess as often as I used to.
