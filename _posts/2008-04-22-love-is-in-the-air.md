There was a hill far away  
On top of which a meadow lay  
A lonesome flower bloomed at sight  
Toughodil was her name  
Amidst strong winds and pouring rain at night  
She shone like a handsome jewel, bright  

There was a happy honey-bee  
From where he came, no one could see  
He sung his worries away all day  
They called him little Wanderbee  
Seeing things, going places  
With buzzing wings and endless glee  

It was early spring one day  
Wanderbee flew up the hill  
Rested in the shade of Toughodil  
Her fragrance was so enticing  
Her honey was so sweet!  
All day long with great relish he passed  
When he was set to leave she said:  
"Do you remember my name, Wander bee??..  
I told you last time you came.."  
"I do not remember anything..  
not even this taste of honey  
but may I know your name please  
if you so persist?"  

"'Tis Toughodil, from far away hill  
I hope you come again.."  

Like the hearts of joyous souls ring  
Like the happiness ocean tides bring  
Love is in the air they sing  
Love is in the air ~ ~ ~  

And it was soon summer  
And Toughodil's shade still softer  
Out of the worldly worries  
Away from the heat  
Wanderbee closed his eyes  
While smiling in his dreams.  
When he was set to leave she said:  
"Do you remember my name, Wander bee??..  
I told you last time you came.."  
"I do not remember anything..  
not even this taste of honey  
but may I know your name please  
if you so persist?"  

"'Tis Toughodil, from far away hill  
I hope you come again.."  

Suddenly there was autumn  
Leaves started to fade  
But Toughodil as tough can be  
Continued to bloom away  
As Wanderbee entered his safe refuge  
Her honey was life, her fragrance hope  
Thought he, no matter what time of the year  
I could live in this place forever!  
When it was time to leave she said:  
"Do you remember my name, Wander bee??..  
I told you last time you came.."  
"I do not remember anything..  
not even this taste of honey  
but may I know your name please  
if you so persist?"  

"'Tis Toughodil, from far away hill  
I hope you come again.."  

All this time, every day  
Wanderbee in his comfy home  
Thought about Toughodil  
To his fellow bee-friends  
he narrated his story:  
"There is a flower on far away hill  
Goes by the name of Toughodil  
Her sight is like a hallowed angel  
Her taste a fountain of life!  
For ages I have loved her  
But am too scared to confess  
I do not know how she feels for me  
What if I lose all I have!"  

Like the hearts of joyous souls ring  
Like the happiness ocean tides bring  
Love is in the air they sing  
Love is in the air ~ ~ ~  

And along came the torrid winter  
Animals ran here and there for shelter  
Everything was white and on snowy hold  
And Wanderbee was freezing cold  
In his way up far away hill  

There he was shocked in nothingness  
Toughodil seemed not as tough anymore  
Faded and colourless she lied  
The cold was too strong for her might!  
There was no fragrance anymore  
The honey had dried!  
Wanderbee could not believe his life  
Had taken quite a turn  
Feeble and weak he lied on the snow  
And closed his eyes again  
The wind seemed to whisper  
He understood what it meant:  

"You do not remember my name, Wander bee..  
Though I told you last time you came..  
There is something else which I needed to say  
But it is now too late  

I adored your little flapping wings  
The simple songs you sung  
Your smile (while you slept) was everything to me  
Your love, I longed for so long!"  

Wanderbee now smiled as he faded  
Being buried in snow he slowly said:  
"Death took you away dear Toughodil  
I was late, I was wrong in my ways  
But there is something which I can do (even now)  
I'll lie here and wait for you..  

My love.. I'll lie here and wait for y-o-u..."  

Like the hearts of joyous souls ring  
Like the happiness ocean tides bring  
Love is in the air they sing  
Love is in the air ~ ~ ~
