I do not understand them  
Why they ostracize my home  
The house that I live in  
And been living for quite sometime  


Friends I have few (But who has friends in the city anyways?!)  
Was a loner as long as I can recollect  
All day I sit on my desk and scribble  
At nights on life I retrospect  


They called the house haunted  
This very house that I live in  
(Maybe they saw the cobwebs in the basement  
Little realising the art within!)  
I do not hear them, let alone see  
The spirits that supposedly reside with me  

But one night on the attic while I was scribbling  
A story about a lonely writer  
I heard a slight sound â€“ a knock  
Of the door closing, creaking tighter  

I climbed down the stairs  
Carefully tip-toed  
Saw a woman in a white gown  
Blonde locks hanging down  
Yes, she has to be the one  
The ghost at last I found!  

Terrified at first, I was stuck in painless silence  
Unending, unforgiving, my feet were numb  
Crouched on the stairs, heart in mouth, knowing not  
Whether to run, or scream aloud!  

Then came a second knock  
Who could it be now?  
Itâ€™s been long since I had a visitor  
Were there more of them now?  

The saintly spirit answered the door  
And in came a man from the other world  
Together they seemed to smilingly whisper  
"There is no-one, we are alone..."  

Shocked out of my wits  
My life was at stake  
Moving back I stumbled on the vase  
A shattering sound it did make  

They shrieked, and shouted "Whoâ€™s there?"  
And that was when I rose up in fright  
The woman screamed, the man grabbed her  
They both bolted out of sight  

As they ran, Jon cried out loud  
And Matilda nodded in too  
"What they said was true, my dear  
...what they said was true!"

- **Ashish Anand** (on August 8, 2008) : Witty in a very peculiar way. Apparently, the poem gives an idea about Saikiaâ€™s current state of mind. Nice one Saikia. Keep posting more poems ðŸ™‚

- **Ipchita Bharali** (on August 9, 2008) : A very amusing one again.. kind of reminds me of the movie "The Others" but it has its own uniqueness.. i must visit your blog more often for these delightful treats ðŸ™‚

- **Himangshu Saikia** (on August 11, 2008) : Well, I forgot to mention my inspiration for this one! Indeed it was influenced by my dear friend Anubhaw's description of "The Others" (but he didn't mention the name of the movie at that time), as well as the exquisite (read: "jaw-dropping") ending of "The Sixth Sense" which remains etched in my mind till today ðŸ™‚

- **Arpit Garg** (on December 11, 2008) : Nice one Saikia da!

- **Sarang Sharma** (on March 17, 2009) : Haha... Cool poem man... "The Others" to yaad aayi sahi mein... But I also remembered a joke -:  
Ghost1 (to ghost2) â€“ Have you seen that human who lives above?  
Ghost2 â€“ Rubbish. There is no such thing as a human. ðŸ™‚  

- **Maharnab Hazarika (aka Maya Butler)** (on January 21, 2012) : Never could write anything ghostly or haunted. But loved it..:) specially your mentioning of disregarded details in brackets.
