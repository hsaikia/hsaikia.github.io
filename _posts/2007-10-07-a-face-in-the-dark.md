This was one story which had always enthralled me as a kid, to put it into poetry wasn't that difficult. I hope it still preserves a part of Ruskin Bond's magic with storytelling ðŸ™‚

I was a teacher in a small town  
I was kind and giving  
Spent my time with simple children  
Teaching virtue and truthful living  
"Always believe what is seen by your eyes  
Or heard by your own ears  
'Cause a rumour spreads faster than light  
And confusion is all it smears.."  

Villagers there were many  
Part of a superstitious lot  
No matter what reasoning provided  
Fear still lurked in their hearts  
The children simple beings they were  
Feared the paranormal too  
Scared of the graveyard that lied on the outskirts  
Made a point to avoid that route  
That led right through to school  
And was haunted by spirits and ghouls  

One day the sun went down sooner  
And it had grown quite dark  
I had to walk my way back home  
All the way down the long path  
But there was this route through the graveyard  
That was 'haunted' yet was short  
Ghosts and spirits are all in our minds  
Thinking to myself I laughed  
While starting to walk that path  
Firmly my beliefs I held.  

As it grew spookier  
Strange sounds seemed to howl  
In the darkness lurking shadows  
Seem to move and prowl  
My heart was pumping hard  
A strange feeling surrounded the air  
As if someone's creeping up from behind  
Or was it just my mind?  
Daringly I walked on  
Every step in two minds I took,  
Hoping to find my way, with limbs that shook  
Telling myself every moment  
Not once behind must I look  

Suddenly a voice was heard  
It grew distinct slowly  
A voice seemed to wince  
And seemed to weep  
It was a girl behind a tree  
Face hidden in her knees  
An enormous pain seemed to shroud her  
Knowing not what it was  
I walked right upto her and asked  
"What happened, little girl?"  

She would not lift her head up for me  
No matter how I persist  
At length when I bended down to see  
A horrifying sight awaited me  
There was no face  
No eyes, no nose, no lips  
A face as blank and pale  
As a sheet of paper  
Gleaming in the moonlight  
Staring fixedly at me..  

I took to my heels  
As fast as I could  
I let my legs run free  
In disbelief of what I'd seen  

Everything was hazy to me  
As I was running out of breath  
A glimmer of light came as hope  
At the deep end of the road I could see  
Someone holding a lantern low  
As I neared and stopped to breathe  
The man came close to be  
"What happened Sir, how come you're here?"  
He inquired in a tone of strange monotony  

I huffed and puffed and cried out loud  
"There's a girl without a face.."  
"She had no eyes, no nose nor lips.."  
"She ought to be a ghost..!"  
Calmed down the chowkidar at my story  
And came closer still  
Held up the lantern high enough  
And said these words slowly  
"Do you mean it was like this.... Sir?"  
And I stared in disbelief  
A man without a face.. again  
Seemed smiling straight at me..  

A gutsy stroke of wind came down  
Someone heard a shout  
As silence took over everything  
And blew the lantern out...

- **Himangshu Saikia** (on October 7, 2007) : thanks mate ðŸ™‚ I sure will..

- **Santanu Baishya** (on November 28, 2007) : Witnessing all truth might not bring fortune always...we should do go for scientific reasons but at the same time should stay careful of the odds too....because in this world there are facts that we still don't know, or yet to know...anyway, it was horrifying...hehe.

- **Himangshu Saikia** (on November 28, 2007) : AFAIK, Ruskin Bond is no scientist! So he made it look so true (still am unsure about spirits) And the character here just didn't believe in ghosts, he didn't try to reveal the truth about them or anything.. seems like he was unsure about his own beliefs.
