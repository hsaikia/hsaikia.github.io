  <h1><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hsaikia.github.io&#x2F;the-haunted-house&#x2F;">The Haunted House</a></h1>
  
  <div class="post-content"><p>I do not understand them<br />
Why they ostracize my home<br />
The house that I live in<br />
And been living for quite sometime</p>
<p>Friends I have few (But who has friends in the city anyways?!)<br />
Was a loner as long as I can recollect<br />
All day I sit on my desk and scribble<br />
At nights on life I retrospect</p>
<p>They called the house haunted<br />
This very house that I live in<br />
(Maybe they saw the cobwebs in the basement<br />
Little realising the art within!)<br />
I do not hear them, let alone see<br />
The spirits that supposedly reside with me</p>
<p>But one night on the attic while I was scribbling<br />
A story about a lonely writer<br />
I heard a slight sound â€“ a knock<br />
Of the door closing, creaking tighter</p>
<p>I climbed down the stairs<br />
Carefully tip-toed<br />
Saw a woman in a white gown<br />
Blonde locks hanging down<br />
Yes, she has to be the one<br />
The ghost at last I found!</p>
<p>Terrified at first, I was stuck in painless silence<br />
Unending, unforgiving, my feet were numb<br />
Crouched on the stairs, heart in mouth, knowing not<br />
Whether to run, or scream aloud!</p>
<p>Then came a second knock<br />
Who could it be now?<br />
Itâ€™s been long since I had a visitor<br />
Were there more of them now?</p>
<p>The saintly spirit answered the door<br />
And in came a man from the other world<br />
Together they seemed to smilingly whisper<br />
&quot;There is no-one, we are alone...&quot;</p>
<p>Shocked out of my wits<br />
My life was at stake<br />
Moving back I stumbled on the vase<br />
A shattering sound it did make</p>
<p>They shrieked, and shouted &quot;Whoâ€™s there?&quot;<br />
And that was when I rose up in fright<br />
The woman screamed, the man grabbed her<br />
They both bolted out of sight</p>
<p>As they ran, Jon cried out loud<br />
And Matilda nodded in too<br />
&quot;What they said was true, my dear<br />
...what they said was true!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Ashish Anand</strong> (on August 8, 2008) : Witty in a very peculiar way. Apparently, the poem gives an idea about Saikiaâ€™s current state of mind. Nice one Saikia. Keep posting more poems ðŸ™‚</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ipchita Bharali</strong> (on August 9, 2008) : A very amusing one again.. kind of reminds me of the movie &quot;The Others&quot; but it has its own uniqueness.. i must visit your blog more often for these delightful treats ðŸ™‚</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Himangshu Saikia</strong> (on August 11, 2008) : Well, I forgot to mention my inspiration for this one! Indeed it was influenced by my dear friend Anubhaw's description of &quot;The Others&quot; (but he didn't mention the name of the movie at that time), as well as the exquisite (read: &quot;jaw-dropping&quot;) ending of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; which remains etched in my mind till today ðŸ™‚</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arpit Garg</strong> (on December 11, 2008) : Nice one Saikia da!</p>

<p><strong>Sarang Sharma</strong> (on March 17, 2009) : Haha... Cool poem man... &quot;The Others&quot; to yaad aayi sahi mein... But I also remembered a joke -:<br />
Ghost1 (to ghost2) â€“ Have you seen that human who lives above?<br />
Ghost2 â€“ Rubbish. There is no such thing as a human. ðŸ™‚</p>

<p><strong>Maharnab Hazarika (aka Maya Butler)</strong> (on January 21, 2012) : Never could write anything ghostly or haunted. But loved it..:) specially your mentioning of disregarded details in brackets.</p>
