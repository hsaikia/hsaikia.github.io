  <h1><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hsaikia.github.io&#x2F;my-life&#x2F;">My Life!</a></h1>
  
  <div class="post-content"><p>This one was written in the workspace one night.. it was half past midnight and I was alone.. actually I wasn't alone.. Raj was there, but he was sleeping (on three chairs), snoring away, so, technically I was alone. There was perfect silence. And no opponent to play Tekken with ðŸ˜¦ Anyways it was half past 12 and the canteen normally closes at 2AM. I had one and a half hour to kill... hence the poem.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was born a hard metal<br />
I was a sight to behold<br />
They flattened, twisted and curved me up<br />
Till my skin shined like gold<br />
My head was sharp<br />
My body slim<br />
Maybe they put all their sweat<br />
While carefully all my edges trim<br />
In admiration they saw me rise<br />
I could see my destiny in their eyes</p>
<p>I am a happy little soul<br />
I am glad that I am here<br />
The world seems so beautiful<br />
Forever at all the sights I could stare</p>
<p>I slid down the tunnels<br />
And rolled on the corrugated sheets<br />
Life seemed to move so fast<br />
But now I had company<br />
Of other happy souls like me<br />
They did not talk, nor did they smile<br />
Maybe they were plain emotionless<br />
Or maybe just too shy<br />
But deep inside I somehow knew<br />
They were glad to be here too</p>
<p>I am a happy little soul<br />
I have found others like me<br />
I guess we all share a purpose<br />
To live up to our destiny</p>
<p>Once out of the factory<br />
I travelled far and wide to distant places<br />
Some of us, rusted and broken, named 'invalid' and dead<br />
Ended up being discarded<br />
Slowly the truth dawned on me<br />
That the world had place for only the fittest<br />
And I was proud to be amongst the best,<br />
Being a part of the chosen few<br />
Having no color, no race, no religion<br />
Just the faith to do what was due</p>
<p>I am a happy little soul<br />
Grown up, been lucky too<br />
By air, water and land I travelled<br />
To know what I needed to do..</p>
<p>It was long before we stopped<br />
When me and my friends saw light<br />
Sold to strangers who looked down on us<br />
Dropped us down to the ground from a height<br />
We rolled, here and there, amidst thousands of us<br />
It was a congregation of happy souls!<br />
All shapes and sizes these people bought<br />
Picked up, stuffed into barrel holes<br />
To stay tight and firm, we fought<br />
My heart pounded, my mind had a thought<br />
&quot;This is the time (for so long) I sought!&quot;</p>
<p>I am a happy little soul<br />
Finally I found my chance for fame<br />
In a strange smoky barrel<br />
Kalashnikov was its name</p>
<p>As I waited patiently<br />
Time seemed like eternity<br />
Constant sounds of blasts and screams<br />
And trickling blood<br />
Filled the same air I breathe<br />
&quot;The world is not as happy as I thought..&quot;<br />
The dreams shattered, the aura gone!<br />
Suddenly I hoped, not knowing why<br />
Scared for the first time in my life<br />
I wished I had.. never came by</p>
<p>I am a confused little soul<br />
Scared of the truth which hurts<br />
I wish life was faster now<br />
I don't want this pain to last!</p>
<p>And 'Boom' it did sound!<br />
I flew out of the small hole<br />
Making my way through thickets and trees<br />
Breathless, blind and bold<br />
In exact silence I sped through<br />
Stopped for a moment before rushing in<br />
Slipped through blood and to a standstill<br />
Finally realizing my true purpose<br />
The meaning of my existence!<br />
Piercing a human heart, shot from a gun..<br />
I lay dumb and motionless, shocked at what I had done</p>
<p>I am a sad little soul<br />
Lived my life, served my time<br />
All my pride was for nothing<br />
My purpose â€“ to kill a child!</p>
<p>Shameful of my creation, guilt is all I gain<br />
I wish to run away, to be burnt, and never felt again..</p>

<p><strong>Ashish Anand</strong> (on March 13, 2008) : Saikia bondâ€™s masterpiece !!!<br />
The last few stanzas of the poem are really great.<br />
Rock on Saikia ðŸ™‚</p>

<p><strong>Abhinav Jha</strong> (on March 13, 2008) : Now that's the way a poem is supposed to be written ! Only someone like Saikia Bond can put life into an inanimate object such as a bullet. Reminded me of the movie &quot;Lord of war&quot;, though. Nice one ! I am no expert on poems, but I like the fact that you don't try to make lines rhyme for the heck of it. Nice work, keep them coming !</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Himangshu Saikia</strong> (on March 13, 2008) : Thanks guys for your insight. I'd forgot to mention one thing, The opening credits from the movie 'Lord of War' was what inspired me to write this one, kudos to you Jha Bond, as always youâ€™re bang on!</p>

<p><strong>Kshitij Maheshwari</strong> (on March 13, 2008) : wellâ€¦.. i dnt have ne words

<p><strong>Maharnab Hazarika (aka Maya Butler)</strong> (on January 21, 2012) : Good writing. Really Liked the emphasis of the line- i am a happy little soul and then the change of the feelings by a word. And the situations you pointed were realistic.:)</p>
