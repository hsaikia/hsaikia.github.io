The more intricate the strategy, the greater the feeling of wonder and appreciation. Games like Chess and Go have an aesthetic component associated with them, for these very reasons. The social bonding (or not) that results from playing board games in tight friend and family circles is beyond the scope of this article. The focus here is more on the aspects that need to be considered by a player while making their decisions during a game. Strategies are very akin to real life decision making - where all aspects of a situation have to be understood and analyzed before making a decision. Often times it is necessary to consider not just the short term benefits of making a decision, but the possibilities that may arise from extrapolations of that decision into the future.\nBoard Game AIs evoke a similar sense of excitement - that of amazement and discovery - when these AI programs discover strategies from scratch, that have been discovered after lot of human thought. However the greatest feeling arises when an AI discovers strategies that were previously unknown to humans, thereby contributing to the human knowledge base and expanding it.\nCommercial board games are different from age-old classics like Chess and Go. There is a large number of commercial board games and not all of them become popular. A popular board game has to excel in several aspects - artwork, theme, mechanics, play time and to an extent, level of difficulty. Keeping the other topics aside, here we only consider board game mechanics. If the mechanics are designed in a way that there is scope for over-powered (OP) strategies, the design is flawed. An OP strategy allows a player to very easily tilt the outcome of the game with little effort, and sometimes due to sheer luck (e.g., being handed an OP card for instance) thus ruining the competitive and equal opportunity assumptions at the start of the game. For this reason, extensive play testing of a game is extremely important before its release, to discover and completely iron out any such inconsistent strategies. This aspect is sometimes not paid enough attention to as it should - and thus unfortunately makes a splendid looking game, not so attractive to seasoned players.\nBoard game AIs can greatly accelerate play testing, by identifying OP mechanics using simulation of a large number of games. Monte Carlo Tree Search, or MCTS, is one such AI technique that is agnostic of the game mechanics and (theoretically) converges to the optimal play relying only on a large number of simulated outcomes.\nAgricola - Farming in 17th century Europe\nAgricola is a popular turn-based strategy board game by Uwe Rosenberg. The theme of the game is 17th century farming - where players take on the role of a farmer, who has to tile their lands, sow and harvest their crops, breed their farm animals, expand their family and build/renovate their homes with better material. For each of these activities there are action spaces on the board, which are succesively used by players in a turn based manner. Points are rewarded for improving each aspect of the farm (diversity is important!). The winner is the one who has scored the most points at the end of the game. \nAgricola is also regarded as a very punishing game, as getting the action sequence for a particular set of actions (or even all of them) right, is very important. One missed opportunity or a blind spot here and there, and the results could be disastrous. \nOver the years, Agricola has seen several expansions to the base game. These expansions introduced a whole new bunch of cards to the base set of cards (called Occupations and Minor Improvements) that enhance the gameplay with infinitely many new strategies arising from combining them in clever ways. Over time the community has identified a set of cards that are 'ban worthy', meaning that these cards can result in OP strategies and are therefore banned in any sort of competitive play. \nMy attempt in this project, was to implement the base version of the game. Implementing Occupations and Minor Improvement cards is going to be a mammoth task, and I might get to doing that sometime in the future. However, the purpose of this project was to demonstrate the capabilities of an AI algorithm in playing the game at a very decent (intermediate) level.\nMonte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\nThere are several techniques to evaluate the best move to play in a turn-based strategy (tbs) game. Minimax / Negamax is a well known technique to find best moves in a two player zero sum game, such as Chess. Alpha-Beta pruning is a technique used to prune the exponentially growing search tree in the Minimax algorithm. Though this is a very good technique, it often fails to explore certain branches that have a delayed reward - e.g., a sacrifice (bad initial move) that leads to checkmate (best final result) - and is very dependent on its evaluation function for a particular game state.\nMCTS, on the other hand, makes no such assumptions. It is a purely knowledge-agnostic technique, which means that it requires no prior knowledge of how a game state is evaluated. It picks up on the best strategies as it searches through the game tree and is theoretically capable of perfect play given infinite resources. Hence its performance scales up with the number of searches it performs.\nAgricola is a complex game with several actions within actions - known as split actions. MCTS is one of the few techniques that works with split action games as well.\nAgricola is also an 'imperfect information' game, where certain information about the future board state as well as player hands (Occupation and Minor Improvement cards) are hidden from other players. While forward simulating playouts for such games from the perspective of player A, care must be taken to sample hidden actions from the entire hidden state space for all other players apart from A, rather than only from their own possible hidden actions. This ensures that player A does not 'learn' about the strategies that follow after other players play a hidden card from their hand, way before they actually play it.\nIn the current implementation, care is taken to not use a predetermined board state (knowing how the hidden board states will reveal themselves) but reveal hidden states during the simulated playouts - such that the AI does not 'learn' the best strategy by accessing a predetermined state (and thereby already knowing what's coming in the future).\nWhy Rust?\nI chose Rust as my programming language for this project. Rust's incredible speed and memory safety coupled with several features akin to modern languages, instantly made me delve right into it. So far, dabbling with Rust for over a few weeks now, I have to say that it has emerged as one of my favorite languages to program in. Rust's ecosystem and community is one of the best out there, and frameworks such as the game engine Bevy, which uses Entity-Component-Systems (ECS) as its default paradigm, makes it especially attractive for projects that I usually like to work with.\nIn this project, the default Hash trait really came in handy. This trait implements a default hashing strategy for any kind of struct (provided all of its nested structs are also implementing the Hash trait) which allowed for easily implementing a game state cache that is needed by the MCTS algorithm.\nRust also encourages writing a lot of declarative style code (popularly referred to as idiomatic Rust) rather than imperative style code. This makes code more human readable and easier to reason about. In this project however, I am certain that a large number of improvements can be made in terms of writing certains pieces in a declarative style. \nIf you're interested in the project, you can find the source code here.\nObservations and Learnings\nUpon letting the AI agents battle themselves out, as well as playing the agents myself (as an intermediate player) I observed some key strategies. Given that my implementation isn't perfect - I encoded some sub actions to be locally handled as I did not want the search tree to become unmanageable - the AI agents learned an optimal strategy around it. In a 2p game, the AI agents consistently scored about 45-50 points and in a 4p game, they scored about 30-40 points - which are relatively good scores considering that they were only allowed an MCTS cache size (game states that the search tree would be expanded to) of 20,000 game states per move. The AI however did not see deep enough to understand the well-known human strategy of trying to grow the family first so that the cumulative number of actions could be maximized. However, it prioritized farming and fencing a lot, and often ended up with complete pastures with sizeable animal populations alongwith a large number of fields. It did not prioritize building rooms as much as normal human players, but still ended up with good scores with a small family size. The AI also prioritized stacking a lot of food in the initial game just to make sure that they didn't have to take begging tokens. Since the base game has limited sources of food, this seemed like a reasonable strategy. In the future, interesting experiments would entail increasing the cache size to see if the AI can indeed discover these deep human strategies.\n","id":"https://hsaikia.github.io/agricola-ai/","title":"My learnings from writing a board game AI in Rust"},"https://hsaikia.github.io/archive/":{"body":"","id":"https://hsaikia.github.io/archive/","title":"archive"},"https://hsaikia.github.io/das-leben-ist-schoen/":{"body":"This one was part of German class (level D3 at Max Planck) wherein we had a poem template and some lines to fill in.

Guwahati, the largest city in Assam, is my hometown. But I always had more reasons to detest Guwahati than to like it. There were many reasons for my displeasure — the overall state of the city, unplanned buildings, terrible (or rather no) drainage, the unruly traffic, the difficult and utter chaotic public transportation, the crass attitude of the people, pollution and all of the rampant corruption. Besides, the summer months are terribly hot even (and especially) inside the house and I am not someone who is a huge fan of extreme weather conditions. However, a visit to my grandparents’ home close to Jorhat town always used to be exciting. I loved the surroundings, the trees, the gentle breezes, the plentiful ‘baris’ (vegetable gardens), the animals and birds, the huge pond, and mostly the simple people. It was always relaxing to spend time in a village, away from the city life, but a few days in and one comes to realize that all of the quietness and peaceful atmosphere also have their drawbacks — frequent power cuts, needing to travel a long distance just to get an LPG cylinder refill, lack of high quality educational institutions or the unavailability of quality health care for my ailing grandparents, which meant they’d always have to travel to the nearest large city — my hometown Guwahati, of which I mentioned the cons before. I imagined that this trade-off always had to exist and was a part of the natural order of things.\nIn the city, space (land) is the most expensive resource, hence the possibility of growing one’s own food in a ‘bari’ doesn’t exist for most people living there. Also if one is not well off, life is quite a struggle. For example one cannot afford an air-conditioner during the summer months, or an inverter (a very large car battery) to use during power cuts. The only thing that was better in the city was the possibility of attending a better school or college, and having access to more career opportunities.\nCut to the present, 7 years hence, I’ve lived away from Assam. Firstly, two years in Bangalore where I worked in the industry. Thereafter, I moved to Germany to pursue my Masters and now I’m living in Sweden, working on my PhD and continuing on an academic career. Living in Europe expanded my horizons and led me to realize a lot of things. Firstly, you don’t need to own much to live a good life. People here are very different to how people are in India — they are less stressed with life and worry less about the future. And surprisingly this is not a result of owning more, but rather everyone being more equal. I also began to read more and discover about alternative lifestyles in the West, where people were turning towards a more holistic form of living. I read about eco-villages, community housing, resource sharing, money-less living, free education and the impact that such holistic living has had on people. It dawned on me that this entire rat race of running after money, and a job which pays more money, and an education which leads to such a job, and the corruption prevalent in all of these spheres is totally unnecessary. It is like a backward step towards a more humane and civilized society. And all of this is because of the lack of basic resources and the scarcity that plagues us in India, and the way that we think is the right way to fix this — try to own more stuff for ourselves. I wonder if this approach had made us any happier. Thinking a bit back in time, where our villages thrived at one point in history while living holistically, but are abandoned now in lieu of a ‘better life’ in a mega city — leading to unsustainable populations and all of their after effects. I thought to myself, if people had all the basic resources that they needed — food, clothing, shelter, education, healthcare and a feeling of community, would they still flock to the cities? Because at the current level of technology that the world is at, global scarcity is not an unsolved problem, it is only the distribution that is messed up.\nIn the last 7 years, I also began to think more about my homeland, and the people living in Assam. They do not possess most of the facilities taken for granted in the West. But the most important thing that they do not possess is the knowledge of how far technology has advanced! Most technologies are prevalent in India, but are not widespread. And people are not interested (or even aware) in truly life-improving technologies as the education that most of the youth seek is mostly in those fields which land a job with a good salary. This is justified because everyone wants a good life. Hence they move into banking, finance, MBA, law and the engineering of drilling oil. Which perpetuates the vicious cycle of ignorance, waste and infinite consumption. If people did not have to go full circle and realize it the hard way as most people in the West have (that owning more doesn’t guarantee more happiness) India would progress way more rapidly, not just in GDP, but in overall happiness of its populace. Indeed, in recent decades, although the GDP has increased, the average Indian has not become more happy, definitely not counting those who finally succeeded in becoming an NRI, and hence presumably happy.\nA NEW SOCIO-ECONOMIC SYSTEM\nI’m a big fan of decentralized systems. They are way more easier to handle and manage than a centralized system. Also when one part goes wrong, the remaining parts keep functioning, largely regardless of the failing part, depending on how independent each part is. This is true for what is known as peer-to-peer computer networks, crypto-currencies, smart contracts and many other systems in software. The same principle can be applied to a social network. Dunbar’s number is a value assigned to the maximum number of close relationships that one person may have in their lifetime. This includes family, friends, partners, colleagues and all of the people one might encounter during their lives. This number is 150. Hence it is possible to assume that 150 or its thereabouts is a good estimate for the size of an independent community working and living together as a group.\nThe economy of sharing works as follows — every single person volunteers to work according to his or her skill set. Or to do the things they like to do. Jobs which are ‘valuable to life’ are the only jobs necessary in this economy. For example farming, teaching, engineering, design and construction. All other jobs are either needless or are delegated to computers. Technology is fully embraced in this economy and there are no such things as planned obsolescence — everything is made to last as long as possible and with the best materials available nearby. Since there is no concept of money, or profit, this kind of thinking is made possible. Also the entire thought process of creating something lies in sustainability and preservation. That is to use materials which are good, cost effective, easier to maintain in the future, and easily recyclable — a thought process which is severely lacking in our current systems of economy, in nation states, all around the world.\nThe aim of this system being small and decentralized is facilitated by all of its requirements being off-grid. That is, all of the resources that this community needs for a rich and thriving lifestyle are made available on site. Food can be grown on gardens and greenhouses, and possibly with modern techniques like hydroponics, aquaponics and aeroponics, on ground or on terraces, or even building walls — providing for more than adequate food supply for the residents. More resource intensive or exotic food that cannot be grown on site, can be procured from outside the commuity by money earned from skill exchanges, which I shall describe in a moment.\n\n\n    \n    A vertical aeroponic system. Aeroponics and Hydroponics allow vegetables to be grown without the usage of soil.\n\n\n\nThe main challenge of living off-grid is power (hence off-grid), but with the advent of technology it has also become very feasible and practical for power to be a decentralized resource. The sun, which can be thought of as the largest naturally occuring nuclear reactor, shines in abundance in almost all parts of India, and most parts of the world. It is indeed, the only energy source powering the entire planet since eternity. Hence it is only obvious that solar should be the primary source of power. In Assam, there is no dearth of rivers and streams, which means small scale hydro projects like vortex flows could also possibly be used to generate power. Besides there are other options like wind etc. A solar system, once set up, requires almost no additional maintainance and can provide electricity to the entire community at all times. But as always, since preservation is key, residents should use all resources judiciously.\n\n\n    \n    Power generation capacity additions in GW. Renewables just recently tipped fossil fuels to become the largest means of power generation in the world. Source: BloombergBusiness.\n    \n\n\nAnother important resource is water. Thinking of Assam, the mighty river Brahmaputra and the problems that we face with drinking water, or with the amount of rainfall that we get, owing to which our streets always getting clogged with floods ever since I can remember, I cannot seem to be bemused enough at the irony of it all. The one thing that we should have been masterful at is the use of water! This really shows our combined progress (or rather, anti-progress) as a society.\nBlaming governments and corrupt leaders do not lead us to solutions. More importantly, we need to learn how to harness the power of water. Ample amounts of drinking water can be obtained using natural multi-layer filtration methods on rainwater, harvested through the roofs of buildings. This water can also be used for other household purposes like in the kitchen or showers. The idea of all water flowing through European taps being potable is something I really like a lot. And a well thought of rainwater harvesting and drainage system on our roofs can make this very easily affordable. Water used up in showering or the kitchen can go through a cycle of reuse for flushing toilets after which the resulting water (black water being the technical term) can be treated further and fed to the greenhouse and outer areas, where the plants nourish themselves being part of the same cycle. Furthermore, moats surrounding small buildings can either serve as natural swimming pools or an aeroponic system with fish etc. The important part is to always keep the water flowing using natural elevations or artificial means like a pump for example. Drainage is key. In this way, a well planned design built into the system can both provide for efficiency and usefulness.\n\n\n    \n    Inside of an Earthship\n    \n\n\nShelter is almost the most important part of community living, since a house is what makes the idea perceivable. Keeping up with our principles of sustainability and preservation, the current state of modern construction is nothing but horrifying. Cement and steel are some of the world’s most unsustainable building materials contributing to large amounts of carbon emissions. They are also expensive and owing to malpractices in the construction industry, it is often reported that buildings are not sturdy enough as they are supposed to be. Indeed cement and steel are strong materials, but they are unsuitable to our climate for many reasons. They neither sequester carbon, something which hempcrete does, nor do they have thermal mass, which cob (a combination of mud and straw) provides. Materials readily available in Assam would indeed be bamboo and cob, which, although people might detest initially as impractical and old fashioned, are the best low-cost and energy efficient building materials, perfect for a home in the hot and humid climate of Assam. Bamboo and Cob houses can be extremely beautiful if designed well. The Green School and the buildings and hotels built by the company Ibuku in Bali, Indonesia are great examples of how beautiful, strong and resilient buildings based on bamboo architecture can be. Cob is known as the best material providing thermal mass, which means a house made of cob would remain cool inside during summers, and warm during winters. Which would reduce energy costs for usage of fans, and possibly remove the need for air conditioners entirely. Also these houses are very strong, and resilient to earthquakes as well. Indeed, cob houses once built can last hundreds of years.\n\n\n    \n    \n    Bamboo buildings in Bali\n\n\n\n\n    \n    Interiors of a cob house\n\n\nApart from greenhouses to produce food, the surroundings of the buildings can also be covered with trees to provide shade and keep the temperatures down during the summer. Composting toilets can be used to allow human waste to be directly recyclable and reducing the amount of water usage.\nAnother very important feature of an independent community is the medium of exchange. Should we go back to barter again? Who decides the costs of resources? Well, in a truly self-sustainable community, the usage of money should be very limited, if at all necessary. The everyday resources like food, water and energy available should be sufficient for all and everyone should have an equal contribution during the construction process and initial setup — essential items like solar panels, computers, building equipment etc. Various in-house and community wide businesses can be set up for income inflow from the rest of the world. Like selling local organic fruits and vegetables, or education provided in schools within the community for people willing to learn a skill, but not having adequate resources to join a standard classroom. Businesses existing online can be entirely run from within the community, without the hassles of needing to rent out office space or maintaining a hierarchy of workers as in a standard company. Everyone is equal, there are no fixed timings, and all the proceeds go to essential items for the entire community. It might seem as if the people in the community will very likely end up in differences owing to issues like ‘who owns how much’, but that is exactly the point to be addressed. To share is to care as a whole. There should be no concept of ‘I’ or ‘myself’ or the need to ‘own’ anything. The only goal is to maintain the overall well-being of the community as a whole, and this indeed will result in increased well being of every individual, as proven to be the case in more equal societies throughout the world. Moreover, no one individual is forced to continue living in the community against their will. The only reason to live together is to want to live together.\nThat being said, the use of a medium of exchange in the form of a crypto-currency is the best way for exchange of valuable goods and services within the community which do not otherwise belong to the common community as a whole. Crypto-currencies are good because they are decentralized and not tied to a central authority like a bank, they are not prone to inflation as the number of currency tokens in crypto-currencies is always a constant and they can be divided to a possibly infinite resolution. They also distinguish a unique form of exchange between the inhabitants within the community and if needed the community themselves can decide on how they want their economy to function, have a minimum wage for everyone, for example. A community wide accepted rate of exchange with standard forms of currency can be decided upon for outsiders who join the community for the first time. There is no use of this currency outside the community.\n\n\n    \n    The Bitcoin is one of the world’s most popular crypto-currency.\n\n\n\nAlthough a lot can be devised upon the use of this currency, the idea should still be to go the money-less way. The monetary system is indeed the cause of all the suffering and hardship that the world is facing right now as it encourages infinite growth (and infinite greed) on a finite planet with finite resources. This can never be sustainable, and the idea of money should not exist in a community striving for equality and harmony with nature and the environment.\nPLANS FOR THE FUTURE\nSo we’ve seen that an almost fully self-sustainable community, with a resource sharing based economy and an outlook towards preservation and conservation can truly be built not only in Assam, but anywhere in India or around the world. But what are the benefits of such a system? For one, all inhabitants get the pleasure of living in a truly rural atmosphere, with natural swimming pools, trees, home grown food, a cosy shelter as well as the sense of community and belonging-ness. If the community manages to house a few experts in the fields of engineering and medicine, the internal expertise gets a big boost. And this is highly likely in a community of 150 or so like-minded individuals. Also, home schooling becomes a possibility if people within the community are well versed with science, arts, history and language, with the internet helping out a great deal as well.\nWith the elimination of money, a great deal of problems are solved automatically. All basic needs being taken care of, and excess of anything not welcomed, the community grows equally with no inherent social stigma or class divisions created due to economic imbalances. Education and progressive thoughts being the key.\nAnother very important thing that several such eco-villages located somewhat away from the bustling cities bring about is a decrease in over-crowding of the cities. Imagine if all villages had all of the basic amenities sorted out, most people will not leave their houses and land in the village and live in slums in and around a city for a better life. By incentivizing the lifestyle in a village to be no worse (even better!) than living in a city, we’ll notice that the life in the city also gets better — with reduced pollution, lesser inconveniences in management and an overall reduced economic inequality leading to lesser crimes and a plethora of other related social problems.\nThus, to build a model self-sustainable, global eco-village is truly the solution to all the inadequacies of the current system in Assam. Organic food, water, shelter and power are freely available to anyone within the community. Education within the community is also freely made available by teachers who volunteer. Houses are built keeping sustainability and preservation in mind. Strong, resilient and readily available natural building materials are used to cut carbon emissions and enable living in a greener way.\nAll of this being said, this good willed, sharing-centric and technologically and humanely progressive community is still a distant dream for me. I am on the lookout for individuals or groups who would possibly be interested in helping me build and live together in this community and make it grow further, to serve as an example for the whole country. I am always looking forward to discuss the current implementation ideas that I presently have, in detail, and ways to improve upon them. I believe in the idea of open-source, which is indeed about sharing resources and know-how. Hence these foundations can only grow with time and improve.\nMy inspiration for these ideas come from various sources and people, most notably Jacque Fresco of ‘The Venus Project’, Peter Joseph’s ‘The Zeitgeist Movement’, Michael Reynolds’ ‘Earthships’, John Hardy’s Green school and Elora Hardy’s works with Ibuku, ideas like Open Source Ecology, AirBnB, Couchsurfing, The World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF) initiative, the Occupy movement and related movements and the countless many eco-village and self-sustainability advocates all around the world for your splendid open-source contributions on the internet. The world is coming together as one, and your work is proof of it.\nOriginally published at http://milspeak.wordpress.com.\n","id":"https://hsaikia.github.io/eco-village/","title":"Is a self-sustainable, off-grid, global eco-village possible in Assam?"},"https://hsaikia.github.io/effort-additive-not-subtractive/":{"body":"\n\n    \n    An Ant Colony.

While Edison’s company was marketing for the already existing DC (direct current) technology, Tesla was advocating for his new high voltage AC (alternating current). Edison went so far as to electrocute live-animals on stage, trying to prove how dangerous AC could be. However, with its farther transmission capabilities, and more efficient central generating stations, AC soon began to be widely accepted and is the primary means of high voltage power transmission today.\nCassettes vs CDs\nWhen music CDs first came into the fray, cassette players were ubiquitous. However, CD manufacturers did not have to put cassettes down to prove that CDs were better. With time, CDs did become better than cassettes in all aspects — their slim size, the quantity of songs that could be crammed into them, their durability owing to lesser number of mechanical components and later their cost.\nNatural vs forced replacement / obsolescence\nAC proved better in certain aspects — like long distance transmission — than DC, and hence won the war of currents, without having to put down DC by means of any negative PR campaign. Today we have both AC and DC operating at the same time, because both are better in certain cases than the other. Similarly, the ways in which a CD became better than a cassette, was enough to make cassettes obsolete, there was no need for any negative publicity, just technological advancement was enough. The same could be said for innumerable tech gadgets like the floppy disks, pagers etc.\nThe takeaway here is that, old obsolete ideas can only be replaced by something new —given that the new is better in most if not all aspects than the old, and in some cases, definitely much better. If a new idea is truly better, no amount of negative publicity can stand in the face of its widespread adoption. Its like the famous Buddhist saying : “These three things cannot be hidden for long — the sun, the moon and the truth”. The truth here referring to the innovative genius of an idea.\nBacklashes at transition points are always imminent\nHumans are emotional beings, that are governed a lot by inertia (unwillingness to change) with varying degrees to which they can perceive the future. The first automobiles were also looked upon with scrutiny when horse carriages were working so well! It is in fact seen throughout history that visionary ideas — like the heliocentric model — were always abhorred, nipped in the bud and even severely punished for.\nHowever, change is the only constant. And without the willingness to change, life would’ve never evolved in the first place.\nHow replacement is akin to addition and subtraction\nWe can formulate the acceptance of a new idea as an addition, when the idea is being actively worked on, and given prominence and attention. At the same time, we can formulate the need to forcefully make the older idea obsolete as subtraction.\nAs may be obvious by the allegories presented by now, addition is the more natural process towards progress, and subtraction is a needless one. But more often than not, we still see a lot of effort being put on subtractive efforts, which unnatural and unnecessary.\nEven in romantic relationships, it is seen that nothing cures the pain and frustration of a failed relationship than another really meaningful relationship. When one really gets rid of the negativity from a past relationship, only then they are well equipped to take on another one. As we saw before, the transition meets a lot of resistance, and negativity doesn’t help.\nHuman Memories and Optimization on Graphs\nRecent studies in Neuroscience claim that any of our memories is just a recollection of the last time we had that memory. Hence, new experiences and new memories take the space of old ones, and during sleep, our brain perhaps recycles our neural structures to fit newer memories into older patterns. Since our brain is always changing, we are always in a constant state of flux — old is slowly getting phased out, and the new is adapted in.\nIn a graph optimization technique called Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), artificial ants are simulated to walk the edges of a graph, and weighing them similar to how real ants lay out a chemical substance known as pheromones. The pheromones evaporate over time, and hence the best path happens to be the one which has the highest pheromone concentration over time. Here I like to visualize the consequence of the constant evaporation as the ‘subtractive’ and the subsequent guided laying out of pheromones as the ‘additive’. Thus, this similar concept of ‘attention to new positives’ and ‘constant unbiased negatives’ in nature can be even adapted to computational problems.\nThe way ahead\nHow do we consciously apply these principles to real life? For one, we should stop focusing on excessive criticism, negativity and judgement. As the world becomes more technological advanced, it gets even more difficult to judge the good from the bad, the true from the false. Fake narratives have clouded our judgements so much that its impossible to guess what goes on beyond what our limited perception allows us. Thus it becomes very important to focus on positivity, always be accepting of new ideas, avoid rigidity and always believe that everything is possible.\nTechnological advances should not be seen emotionally as taking away what we already have and love. They should be seen as windows of opportunity, which will enable us to look into the future and fix all the evils that exist in the world today. What we need, is to see technological accentuated problems with human nature, as social or moral problems, and not as problems with technology itself.\nIn politics, we need to stop labelling people — left, right, centrist etc. — and then dump all our generalizations into them, but rather see ideas as ideas, and people as people. People are way higher dimensional than left or right, liberal or conservative (which are captured by just 2 dimensions!), we should focus on positively influencing parts of a new bill or amendment rather than be innately furious on the supposedly negative aspects blinding ourselves in the process. This way we can stop hating each other by associating with meaningless political ‘sects’ and start to actually move forward as citizens, nations and a collective human species.\nFor life in general, these principles always hold. Cribbing and complaining serves no purpose but only as a waste of time. Hurtful feelings or emotions cannot be tossed away from our memories — any attempt at doing so actually results in more pain than relief. The way ahead is always with exploring new ideas, focusing on the positives and remaining open to change.\n","id":"https://hsaikia.github.io/effort-additive-not-subtractive/","title":"Why efforts must be additive, and not subtractive"},"https://hsaikia.github.io/french-tarrasch/":{"body":"Cloudy Day, nothing to do in the lab, a perfect setting for an online chess game.

Just then when I was slacking down as usual, there came this player out of nowhere, and thrashed me in a French Tarrasch with black, and if that wasn’t enough to dampen my spirits I barely managed to draw the next game playing the Slav with black (not to mention my opponent lost on time control and I had insufficient material to mate..*sigh*) By now I had assumed that my worthy opponent (who IS strong by all means! not that I’m exaggerating, and not because he beat me! C’mon lotsa people in IITG have beaten me isn’t it? ;)) was gonna search for a new opponent, he offered me another game instead. I took the opportunity gladly and having another chance to break his French, I resorted to a different variation this time and won with a well thought out sacrificial combination in the middle game. I lost the next game playing the Slav again(my queen pawn needs work) and won the fifth because of a blunder by my opponent.

Nf3 but that was more so because of terrible play later.. back to the game.\n5.f4 g5\nTaking the pawn will give rise to an equal position but the result is unclear, the idea is to keep the postion as dynamic as possible.\n6.Ndf3 gxf4 7.Bxf4 c5 8.c3 Nc6 9.Bd3 Qb6 10.Ne2\nInitially just after playing 10.Ne2, I realised it was a blunder, which leads to the loss of a pawn, but then there maybe a chance to equalize after castling, hope floats!\n10...Qxb2 11.O-O Qb6 12.Qc2\nConcentrating attack on the h7 pawn, but it is easier said than done.\n12... c4 13.Bxh7\nI don’t know why Fumiripits played that move, it released the tension and left me with no choice, however he hopes to trap the white light-squared bishop with clever play. Anyways the material is even now.\n13... Bg7 14.Ng5\nThe a1-h8 diagonal is blocked, but the bishop has little choice, Ng5 hopes to make the white queen quit its defending job and move to a better square. But its hardly useful, there aren't many better squares around.\n14... Nf8 15.Bg3\nThe point of Bg3 is two-fold, first it sets up the attack on the weak f7 pawn and also strengthens the king's fort, the h4 square seemed more important than it first appeared!\n15... Qd8?? 16.Nxf7!\nI don’t see any point of Qd8 here, but other moves do not achieve much.\n\n\n    \n    Position after 16. Nxf7\n\n\n16... Qe7 17.Nxh8 Bxh8 18.Bg6+ Kd8 19.Nf4 Bd7 20.Bh5 Kc7 21.Rab1 Nh7 22.Ng6 Qg5 23.Qb2\nSetting up a mating trap.\n23... b6 24.Nf4 Bg7 25.Bf7\nBlack averts damage for now, Bf7 atacks the base of the pawn chain, which is the cornerstone of the black defence in the French.\n25... Qe7 26.Qe2 Ng5\n\n\n    \n    Position after 26. Ng5\n\n\nThe position is clear. White pieces are active and set on well placed locations. Black pieces are defending behind the pawn chain. The three pronged pawn chain is the only thing coming in the way of white’s attack, morever white is a pawn and an exchange up. The situation demands a sacrifice.\n27.Nxd5+!!\n\n\n    \n    Position after 27. Nxd5+\n\n\n27... exd5 28.Bxd5 Ne6 29.Qxc4 Rh8\nThe pawn chain has dissapeared and white’s attack is at it’s menacing best\n30.Bxc6 Bxc6 31.d5 Qc5+ 32.Qxc5 bxc5 33.dxe6 1-0 \nBlack resigns.\nOriginally published at http://milspeak.wordpress.com.\n","id":"https://hsaikia.github.io/french-tarrasch/","title":"French Tarrasch against a Ukrainian"},"https://hsaikia.github.io/icpc-asia-regionals/":{"body":"Well this one was long due, being an ACM first timer, I just had to write this post. If someone reading this is intending to get useful how-to's for the ICPC, you've come to the wrong place 😉 But you can always check out the problems here. The final standings for the Kanpur site contest are listed here.\nMorning of the first day we were two men, Harpreet and myself, sans Malik. Nothing much except a good keynote speech from an IBM fellow, during which I was mostly sleepy. Owing to Antaragni, the campus looked greener, with live drama and street dancing couples hogging the road to the lecture halls, IITK offered a more-than-picturesque scene. The dinner was amazing, with great people everywhere, and the Finnish band ‘poets of the fall' were gearing up for the rock show, and yeah, Malik was there at last. We were entertained by the huge crowds which had gathered for the cult-fest, especially the ones at the dance events, they were amazing enough to leave a feeling of sadness, considering how many years it'll take for IITG to come to this level.. *sigh*\nThe next day was different. The contest was going to be tough, as expected. And our team doesn't gel pretty well. Maybe this was the first time we were doing group programming. At the breakfast table Malik was greeted by one of his friends from IITB, whom he had met in France, and soon enough the other introductions followed. It was nice and at the same time intimidating, to be competing with these guys. Malik's buddy was the JEE AIR 10 of our time, and if that wasn't enough, the AIR 1 was also in his team 🙂 Cool isn't it? And pretty much expected... C'mon, even if you got an AIR of 100, doesn't mean you get IITB CS right?! These people were demigods, and they've been to the world finals at Tokyo last year, winning the Coimbatore contest. Man, this one's gonna be good. 😀\nFinally we were there, inside the CC, seated next to a single terminal and lotsa blank sheets. There were seven problems in all, and we had five hours to solve them. Here's a short description of each.\nAlpha-triangle: Objective was to find a triangular combination from a given set of words such that |AB| = |BC| = |CA| and that A.head = C.head, A.tail = B.head, and B.tail = C.tail. Words can be concatenated but cannot be broken down.\nBaby: Variations of the n-queens problem, where from an n-rook position, an n-queen position was to be derived, using minimum number of moves.\nCard: The magician's card trick problem, where from a given combination of four cards belonging to four different suits, a missing fifth card should be determined.\nDeposit: A variation of the compound interest problem.\nExpression: Given a set of characters, an operation table on those characters and a number of strings, the LR and RL equivalence of the strings are to be determined.\nFable: A cat and mouse game in which the least number of steps to change from an initial configuration to a final one is desired.\nGarrison: A typical dfs problem to determine the co-ordinates of unreachable vertices in a graph.\nEventually we couldn't solve problems A and B. And landed up 16th place. NITT guys (read: Prasanna) completed all of them in less than three hours. IITM, IIITH, Univ Moratuwa guys from Sri Lanka and the girls from Taiwan Univ solved all seven in order of increasing time(ranking). It was depressing enough for me and Malik to keep roaming around and not even attend the prize distribution ceremony. Harpreet had left later that evening, and the two of us dared to queue up for the Atif Aslam show amidst thousands of hard-core fanatics. Alas, we had no passes and all there was for us was to watch football in the Hall IX canteen before going to sleep. All in all a good experience, reality check so to say. The only consolation? Tie-ing with the team we met at the breakfast table 🙂 Atleast we were not last year's regional champs to be pulling our hair apart!\nComments\n\nSantanu Baishya (on April 21, 2008) : Don't worry, u r gonna beat the demigods wherever u go.

Most see it for what it is - majority appeasement. But a fact of good humor is that, for human beings, it is always easier to support the idealogies they themselves stand for. It is widely recognized by intellectuals all around the world that change is the only constant. And an idea that cannot change with time, cannot survive. But still, humans are so aversive to change when someone raises a question mark on their own choices, habits, traditions and cultures.\nOne particular instance of this ban culture - the several bans on various forms of exploitation of the cow - is one that I would like to talk about. The cow is revered to be a sacred animal for Hindus - hence to a majority of Indians. Many animals fall into the sacred category, but the cow is believed to be the most sacred of all. It is believed that Lord Krishna was himself a cow-herder and one of his favorite foods was butter. The cow is also quite a useful animal if thought of as a commodity. India is the largest producer (and one of the largest consumers) of milk and milk products, with 16% of global produce coming alone from India[1]. India also is the world’s largest beef exporter with $4.8 billion in revenues from beef and veal (the meat obtained from baby calves)[2]. India is also one of the largest leather producers[3] where there is an ever rising demand for products made out of cow-hide and hides of other animals, throughout the country and the rest of the world. So it is evident that we have successfully commodified and made thriving industries out of cow exploitation - indeed the cow has become a source of wealth and prosperity to our nation - she is indeed sacred as Krishna would testify - and justifiably called ‘mother’ - a symbol of life and nourishment.\nBut amidst all of these facts where the line between being a sacred animal and being a useful piece of commodity becomes hazy, we all forget the most important thing - what does the cow feel about it? Let us for a moment assume, that human beings are superior to other non-humans (a very doubtful conjecture) and that our heightened intelligence is a measure of that superiority. It is a well known fact that all sentient beings - birds, animals and fish - have all the capabilities of humans - intelligence, fear, anger, happiness, sadness, empathy, love. In many instances, animals have proven to have showcased even better quality of intelligence than humans of the same age[4]. It also is very true that we need animals and birds in our life and our world to sustain our planet. Every animal serves its purpose. The ants, the bees, the wolves or the elephants - every single animal serves a particular purpose to maintain the eco-system of the planet. If all the ants were to vanish, our eco-system would immediately collapse. If all the bees were to go, a third of our food crops won’t be pollinated. The same cannot be said of human beings though - the one species which has systematically destroyed most of the eco-system of the planet, and making it move towards a global environmental apocalypse sooner than predicted. Humans are also the only species which has recorded evidence of large scale torture, exploitation and murder of members of their own species. Terms like racism, ableism, sexism, communalism, casteism, classism and homophobia and the discrimination that follows from them - the root causes of all wars and destruction - are found in the human species alone. How then can we self-proclaim ourselves to be superior to other sentient beings? Should we not have put our intelligence to better use, if at all we were intelligent?\nSo the assumption, or even the thought, that human beings are superior to non-humans is very wrong and self-righteous. The term for this thought is Speciescism[5] - now believed to be the mother of all the other -isms mentioned before. All non-humans, as humans, have equal right to life and the planet, regardless of their intelligence, or usefulness to humans, and the sooner this fact is realised and acknowledged the better it is for the planet. Coming back to what the cow thinks of the hugely successful industries surrounding it, can only be imagined as a horrifying biography. The milk industry and its produce - cow’s milk - could be anything but pure in reality. Female cattle in India are converted into milk producing machines mostly through artificial insemination - a forceful injection of semen (an action tantamount to rape) - and once they give birth, their babies are immediately taken away from them to slaughterhouses where they are used in the veal and calf-leather industries[6]. The milk produced is also laden with pus from infections to the cow from being constrained in poor conditions. Recent research has also shed light on a big myth surrounding cow’s milk in India - that it is healthy for the body and is a great source of calcium, a vital component for the development of bones. Milk is also considered to be sacred, and is thus widely used in religious ceremonies. The reality is nowhere near to this belief. The fact that Indians also have the highest rate of osteoporosis and other diseases owing to lack of calcium in the bones should be testament to this. Like all animal protein, milk acidifies the body’s pH levels which in turn triggers a biological correction. A very excellent acid neutralizer - ironically the same calcium found in our bones - is then utilized by the body to correct the ill effects of milk. The calcium found in cow’s milk is hardly absorbed by the body, hence a systematic depletion of calcium occurs the more we drink milk leading to severe bone related diseases in adulthood and old age. Milk is also the most adulterated product in India as the demand for milk is far greater than the produce. So it is far from being pure. Ayurveda actually lists milk as one of the five white poisons[20]. If all this sounds hogwash to you, think about it, isn’t it surprising that every pharmacy in India almost always has a reserve of calcium supplements? How come a country with the highest milk consumption rates - supposedly the best source of calcium - is also the country with the highest calcium deficiencies?\nIf our own health is put aside for a moment, the dairy industry should be recognised for what it is - an industry supporting large scale torture and violence. The booming beef, veal and leather industries are only by-products of the humongous dairy industry. Hundreds of millions of cows are bred in India for milk, most males are sent immediately to slaughter. The females are sent after they have outlived their usefulness. It is not so easy to see that such a large meat industry cannot be sustained if cattle were bred for meat alone. India is also home to the largest cow slaughterhouse in Hyderabad, the inner workings of which, can only be described as hell on earth for the poor animals[7]. The limbs are broken, eyes gouged out, and scalding hot water poured on them for making the skin soft, all while the animal is alive. Then they are hung upside down and their throats slit, slowly letting the blood drip out, while air is pumped into the body through a hole in the stomach, to easily extract the skin, as it is important for animal to be alive for the skin to be of high quality. Then the cow is cut into four parts, and processing machines package the meat into cans ready for export and human consumption. If this description makes you nauseous, think about how it will be to witness this spectacle of human cruelty with your own eyes, and worse, for the animals to go through it every day, day after day, after undergoing a life full of pain and torture to end in such a horrible death. What have they done to deserve this?\nThe cow may be the most exploited animal in India. But we have not left the other animals in peace either. Due to the growing economic stature of the Indian middle class, a society which was largely vegetarian in the past, a condition was forced upon us from the Western invaders, a condition signifying affluence, has taken over - the consumption of meat. And to feed the growing hunger for meat of a country of one billion, extensive measures have to be taken to produce meat in large quantities and in quick time. Hence poultry farms in India (as around the world) have to cram even more chickens into cages and feed them enormous amounts of soy and grain - food which could very well have been used to feed the 200 million Indians who go hungry every day. Seven-eight of these birds are kept locked up in one cage for sometimes over two years, resulting in quite obviously - stress and disease[8]. Moreover, when a bird is slaughtered, death and the very idea of it, often results in stress induced hormones like cortisol - which are then passed on to humans consuming the meat[9]. There are machines to de-beak chickens so that they cannot harm each other while suffering from nervous anxiety in a crammed space. De-feathering techniques exists as well, which involve throwing live chickens in scalding hot water. Pig slaughterhouses are no different. And so are fish and marine farming. According to a professor of marine science getting hooked on a line is “like dentistry without Novocain, drilling into exposed nerves”, all at the same time pulled out of water slowly suffocating to death[18]. Almost all animals meant for food suffer terrible conditions in life and end in a horrifying death. All in the name of some acquired taste which cannot seem to be satiated for anything less. The worst part being, knowing all of what goes on, we still prefer to live in denial rather than give up the taste of something which causes infinite suffering to sentient beings such as us, every day, for each day of our existence.\nMany people attribute consuming meat to be good for health and consider animal protein to be the only source of protein. A lot of ignorance has to be shed on such thinking. Dr Michael Greger in his famous talk ‘Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death’[10] explains in detail using scientific publications on the ill effects of consuming meat and the benefits of a plant-based diet, and how 15 of the 16 leading causes of death in the US are caused only by consuming meat, fish eggs and dairy. Accidents being the 16th one not caused by diet. Indeed it is well known that diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic diseases of the heart and even alzheimers can be attributed to the consumption of animal protein. Fish and other sea-food are shown to have high density of heavy metal deposits like mercury and consuming them directly affects our bodies with poisonous heavy metals as well[[18]. Eating meat literally kills us and it is not a secret to be kept from the public by the huge industries profiteering off meat. The World Health Organization(WHO) eventually also came up with a report that says consuming meat indeed causes cancer[11]. If the law of karma were to be true, the ill effects of consuming something which has such a violent history cannot in any way be beneficial to the consumer. And this is now proven, beyond doubt, to be a harsh reality.\nAround 50 bilion land animals are slaughtered all over the world for food every year. Very large concentrated farms are required to house billions of animals. The single largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions in the world is not the smoke from cars or planes or ships, but the untreated waste of animals in factory farms. Factory farming is responsible for 37% of all methane emissions[12]. Aside from polluting the air, to hold billions of animals, farms require huge amounts of land which results in deforestation and water pollution. Besides, harming the planet, eating meat is harmful for human sustainability as it is the most unsustainable resource. All kinds of animal products have a huge water footprint[13]. One kilogram of beef for example, takes 5000 gallons of water to produce. That is equivalent to the water needed to shower for 1 year! Also the rate of conversion of fossil fuel energy needed to produce an equivalent amount of nutrient energy (calories) from animal sources as opposed to plant sources is very very low, in the case of eggs for example it is 39 to 1[14] which means for 39 units of energy required to produce an egg, it offers only 1 unit of energy as nutrition. This makes meat, eggs and dairy completely unsustainable for a country as large as India, and the world as a whole, and their production is clearly the most wasteful in terms of energy and the environment.\nFood is just one side of the story of animal abuse. Elephants are also regarded as sacred in India, as for Hindus, the elephant headed God - Ganesha, is widely regarded as the remover of all obstacles. Yet, India could be further from the best place for elephants. Elephants being chained and beaten regularly to perform in circuses is a common fact. But temple elephants decorated and used in processions during religious festivals also suffer a great deal. During these festivals the animals have to endure elevated levels of noise from bursting of crackers and thronging crowds. They are chained and paraded for 8–10 hours a day all in the name of lord Ganesha. Yet, no-one even spares a thought to what the animal actually thinks and feels. Exploiting snakes on Nag-panchami, mass sacrificing goats on Eid, or buffaloes on Durga puja, religious festivities and rituals have become synonymous with animal abuse and murder. What kind of God would wish for such evil brought down on His creations, of such magnitude, in His name?\nAnimal experimenting is also on the large in India, with monkeys, rabbits and other animals being extensively used to test new drugs and/or cosmetics. In any phase of life, it is not difficult to find some kind of animal abuse and torture happening for the sake of our needs and pleasure. It is so all-pervading that it may seem difficult to come out of it. But only a very small conscious step in the right direction can provide a large door for mankind to step into the future where such practices of violence and oppresion on non-humans will one-day, become obsolete.\nPART II - A GROWING REVOLUTION\nGandhi once said “Violence begins with the fork”. Although the situation all around seems grim and people are tucked away in their comfort zones, or fighting for causes which seem ‘more important’ for our own species, there is a slow but steady revolution around the world which is growing every day. A revolution which says no to inhumanity, which allows us to accept all sentient beings as part of our planet, which allows for a free expression of love and compassion without any form of hypocrisy or conceit. A plant-based vegan diet, and an overall vegan lifestyle - indicating no use of animal derived products, either for food, or for leisure - while being the most effective form of protest against a grotesque culture surrounding animal abuse, is also slowly proving itself to be the best diet suitable for humans.\nHumans are instinctively friendly to other animals as Gary Yourofsky explains in his famous talk [19] using the example of a child being given a live chick and an apple. Gary claimed that if the child tried to play with the apple and put the chick in its mouth, he would give up on veganism! Of course such a scenario will never take place as children are not predisposed to violence as adults are and eating meat is a result of continued conditioning while entirely keeping in wraps what goes behind the scenes. It is quite scary to think how we program our own children into believing that such inhuman violence and abuse to animals is the right thing to do, while their instincts always teach them to be otherwise. Humans are natural herbivores and there is enough evidence for this fact[15] in scientific literature already. Hence it is more than obvious that a plant-based whole food diet is the best with regards to human metabolism, nutrition and longevity. Dr. Greger’s talk proves beyond doubt that this is true, and a large number of athletes, body-builders and other health enthusiasts are reaffirming this fact.\nMany non-vegans complain that vegan food tastes like cardboard. Although taste is the most selfish reason to hold onto meat, it is also easier to convince someone to eat something else if it were as tastier. Vegan food companies like Just Inc. (formerly Hampton Creek Foods), and Beyond Meat have invested great efforts in coming up with plant based alternatives to meat, which are sustainable, healthy and better for the environment. Hampton Creek CEO, Josh Tetrick, a vegan for 25 years himself, argues that his company’s products aim to be 10 times better in almost all aspects (health, environment and cost) than products (obtained using animals) of his contemporaries. Contests involving best tasting food, such as burgers or cupcakes have already seen vegan winners[16][17] putting all arguments of meat tasting better at rest.\nWe have all the knowledge. We have all the will. All that is needed is the first step. To stop contributing to any more suffering where enough exists already. Every single conscious choice on what to eat, wear or support makes a huge difference - to our health, to the planet, and most importantly to the animals. We need to be the change that we wish to see in the world. And to make a huge change to the world, we might just have to start at our dinner plates.\nOriginally published at http://milspeak.wordpress.com.\n","id":"https://hsaikia.github.io/modern-day-holocaust/","title":"Non-humans — Unseen victims of the modern day holocaust"},"https://hsaikia.github.io/my-best-game-ever/":{"body":"A nap certainly raises my efficiency levels.

Of course my opponent is a 2200+!!\n22. Qf2\nHoping to regain the lost pawn by means of a sham sacrifice.\n22...Qe7 23. Nxh7!\nRegains the pawn and further weakens the black kingside.\n23...Qxh7 24. Qxc5 Qc7 25. Rdf1\nContinuing with the original plan of Rooks on f and h files constraining the black kings’ movement. Hence also the reason to play Rdf1 rather than Rhf1.\n25...Qd6\nAn exchange of queens now will give nothing for the position, with the material even and a higher rated opponent meaning a better endgame, one blunder and it’d be over for me, so I prefer to keep the Queens on board and continue with the attack.\n26. Qf2 Qe7\nPreventing Qf7+ and mate in one. It’s amazing to see no blunders at all! All the more reasons for me to make none either!\n27. Bg5 Qg7 28. Qh4\nHere I’ve seen a combination which will lead to a great advantage in material.\n28...b5 29. Bh6\nTrying to drive the Queen away.\n29...Qh7 30. Bb3 Bd7\nThe combination I thought of earlier might be possible now, the black Queen is constrained by this move. But at the same time it connects the Rooks and lends to the defense of the 8-th rank.\n31. Qg5\nAttacking the black dark squared bishop, a very important piece in this game, 31...Qh8 loses to 32.Qxg6+\n31...Bh8\n\n\n    \n    Position after 31...Bh8\n\n\nAll parts of the puzzle are in place, the combination is in order, the assault begins..\n32. Bf8!!\nExposing the black Queen..\n32...Rxf8\nAnd not 32...Qxh1??? 33. Qxg6+ Bg7 34.Qxg7 mate.\n33. Rxf8+ Rxf8 34. Rxh7 Rf1+\nAn in between move, luckily the white king has a flight square.\n35. Ka2 Kxh7 36. Qe7+ Bg7 37. Qxd7\nThus having a Queen for a Rook and a won endgame, but my history of blunders doesn’t permit me to take the ending lightly, fortunately I have not made any serious blunders as of now.\n37...Rg1 38. Qxe6 Re1\nAnd not 38...Rxg2??? 39. Qh3+ wins the Rook.\n39. Qxc6 Re3 40. Qb7 Re2 41. g4 Rg2 42. Be6\nI don’t know why I played that move, maybe I just want things to look nicer on the board, like having pawns on the same color as the bishop that I have, this drops a pawn however, but I am so far ahead in material that it hardly matters.\n42...Rxc2 43. Qxb5 Rxb2+ 44. Qxb2 Bxb2 45. Kxb2\nI give up the Queen for the last of blacks’ pieces.\n45...Kg7 46. Kc3 Kf6 47. Bc8 Ke5 48. Kc4\nHere I thought it better (easier?) to Queen the a-pawn rather than the passed pawn (yes I am strange) because it’s easier to keep the opposition (also the fact that my king is closer to the a-file than blacks’)\n48...Kxe4 49. Kb5 Kd4 50. a4 Kc3 51. a5 Kb3 52. a6\nNow both pawns are protected by the bishop and the black pawns cannot move. Black’s king cannot defend his own pawns.\n52...Kc3 53. Kc6 1-0\nBlack resigns.\nOriginally published at http://milspeak.wordpress.com.\nComments\n\n\nAnubhaw Srivastav (on April 20, 2011) : Awesome game play.. just analyzed the game with the help of engine, couldn’t find a single weakness in your game.

Image courtesy : 2D shadows of 3D shapes\n\n\nIn his book 'Hyperspace', Michio Kaku stresses on a single underlying concept : \"Everything is simpler, in higher dimensions\". There can be multiple connotations to this. Kaku explains from a Physics standpoint, that several of the fundamental theorems of Physics appear to be specific forms of a general universal theorem in 5 or more dimensions (please refer to the Kaluza-Klein theory). The simplest way to look at it is this : a problem may or may not appear solvable, or even intelligible, when looked at from a limited perception — usually, with the perceptual abilities that created it — but with a little enhanced perception, the solution might appear obvious, even trivial.\nFlatlanders\nKaku talks about flatlanders — creatures that live in a 2D spatial world and are limited to only 2D perceptual abilities — which is not a new concept in itself (first introduced in a Novel called 'Flatland' by Edwin Abbott Abbott in 1884), but by the mathematical technique of induction, it makes it easier to reason about unsurmountable, unbelievable, or unthinkable situations in a 2D world appearing trivial when seen from a 3D perspective.\nImagine a circular shaped flatlander, living in its flat 2D world. The flatlander can be considered to be very intelligent, human-like even, and can question its existence and of the world that it lives in. However, its perception is restricted to its 2D spatial world only and can visually observe projections of its 2D world on a 1D line. Here are some observations :\n\nAny 3D creature (human) can always observe a flatlander inside-out, i.e., can see its inner organs, arteries, veins and all of what constitutes its body. To a flatlander this might seem unreal, magical even. But for the human, this is just an obvious fact.\nThe flatlander cannot observe the human in their entirety. To them, only a single cross section of the human body is visible at any time, or none at all. This might look very weird to them, as the human may appear and disappear from their sight as if by magic. But for a human, it's just natural that moving about in their 3d world may result in different cross sections of their body being visible on a 2D plane.\nThe human can teleport objects or themselves, in flatland. This amounts to moving an object out of its plane of existence into the 3rd dimension and back at another place in the same plane. This effectively seems like teleportation to the flatlander, though this is just a normal 3D translation for the human.\nThese observations seem pretty trivial, but underlie a very important point. What appears to be unthinkable or physically impossible in 2D, is extremely trivial in 3D. Hence, the phrase \"Everything seems simpler in higher dimensions\", holds true as seen from this perspective.\n\nHeight as a perspective\nIn military parlance, having the high ground is seen as a strategic advantage. This is true in FPS games as well. This is because, from the ground (flatland) perspective, one does not get an overall idea of the entire battle, how groups of troops are moving with respect to each other, what effect the terrain has on the battlefield, how the battle evolves over time in certain fronts and so on. From a high ground, with the added perspective of height, one can observe all of this together, and can formulate an optimal strategy to gain an upper hand in the battle. Here, the height adds a 3rd dimension to the 2D battle field, and provides an additional layer of information over what an ordinary soldier fighting in the battle can perceive.\nThe whole is more than the sum of its parts\nThe 5 sense organs that we use to ascertain our entire existence — sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste — not just add up , but hugely complement each other. Losing one, means losing some complementary information in all of them. So an added dimension, a sensory dimension in this case, not only adds to what is already there, but expands the existing abilities exponentially.\nImagine, the case of explaining the color 'Red' to a very intelligent man who has been blind all his life. No matter how hard one tries, it is seemingly impossible to explain this concept which is so abstract to this man. However, explaining the same concept to a child, whose intelligence, in all probability, is orders of magnitude lower than the blind man, is much simpler. Here, the added dimension of sight — a sensory dimension — makes an entirely abstract concept to an intelligent adult, quite trivial to understand to a child.\nWhy is it difficult to understand other people?\nIntelligence has very little role to play, when perception is limited. This is why some conversations between two (groups of) very intelligent people can go on forever without any meaningful conclusion. If one does not understand or grasp the perception (point of view) of the other, it may be impossible to fathom the reasoning or cause of the problem they may find themselves in, let alone work on a solution.\nIn Figure 1, we can observe the two orthogonal projections of a cylinder — a rectangle and a circle. Unless, one sees the entire cylinder as a whole, or both of its projections, it will be hard to reason for someone, just from a single 2D projection alone — that the object could have this specific shape in 3D. This becomes even more difficult for flatlanders, who can only perceive 2D.\nImagine two flatlanders, each seeing either one of the two projections, and claiming that their version is true. They would end up in a never ending argument, unless they knew about the existence of 3D objects, or could observe each others' versions with their own eyes. Similarly, in a real life situation, many times we are unaware of where the other person is coming from, either because we fail to see what they see, or because we are unaware of this higher dimension (reason) which may be causing this conflicting opinion. Both opinions could be truths, or partial truths, but to see the actual truth, one must be open to expanding their perceptions (listen, or sometimes just believe, in the other side, even though one's intelligence disagrees).\nExpanding perceptions in life\nI believe, we are always able to expand our perceptions, listen more, trust more, suspend our egos and prejudices more and empty our minds a bit, so that we can understand the other perspective better. We must always know and realize that there may be (and indeed are) other angles of perception that we are not equipped with, and so, our convictions of what is absolutely right and absolutely wrong, might just be clouded by an inadequate sense of perception in spite of our heightened knowledge and intelligence.\n","id":"https://hsaikia.github.io/perception-intelligence/","title":"Enhanced Perception > Enhanced Intelligence"},"https://hsaikia.github.io/post-monetary-economics/":{"body":"\n\n    \n    A geodesic dome designed by Buckminster Fuller in Montreal, Canada.

Please reach out to in case of questions and doubts, and I would be more than happy in elaborating to any extent on a certain topic, as I believe that the future is something which we are all responsible for.\n2021 update : Some of my views on competition and the economy have evolved over time since this article was first written, but I am mostly still in line with what I wrote then.\nAll Money is Debt.\nHave you ever wondered where your money came from? Or why almost the entire world is in debt? And who do we actually owe these humongous sums to, if everyone is in debt? Why do markets crash and we end up in a financial crisis, like the Great Depression of the 1930s or the Great Recession few years back, and people end up in abject poverty while all major industries, factories and farms still stand? These issues raise serious questions about the workings of our current economic system, free market capitalism and how banks “create money out of thin air”.\nTo depress you a bit more. All money is created out of debt. Most of the debt we see around ourselves does not exist in the first place. Banks create money out of debt. This is why we have people (and nations) going into huge debts which are logically infeasible to pay off. This is the prime reason behind the top 1% of the world’s population owning 40% of the world’s resources (read : money). And people working in financial institutions and all the major stock exchanges make money by buying and selling debt! To understand a bit more clearly let us go back a couple of centuries when money first came into being. This story is commonly referred to as the ‘Goldsmith’s Tale’. Initially as the barter trade became cumbersome, people started to use ‘coins’ of some rare metal, usually silver or gold which facilitated ease of trade. Soon coins became unwieldy as well, and along came a ‘goldsmith’ who offered to safeguard the coins in his huge protected vault, meant to keep his own coins safe, and in turn offer lightweight paper money — some sort of agreement in exchange of which one could get back the gold — which was much easier to use and carry around. He also charged a small rent to his depositors in lieu of safeguarding their coins. Time passed and more and more people started to deposit their gold in exchange for paper money. Also people who formerly asked for loans from the goldsmith, began to ask for paper money instead, owing to its ease of use. The goldsmith thus discovered a clever idea. He could lend his depositors’ gold alongwith his own to his lenders and profit from a larger interest, and since all depositors would never come in all at once to ask their gold back, this would work out well. Soon the goldsmith enjoyed a great income and began to flaunt his wealth, of which the townsfolk — the actual depositors — became suspicious. They all barged in on the goldsmith together one day, to see if he was lending their gold, but to their surprise, all their gold was still in the vault! Nonetheless, they demanded a small interest for their deposits, which the goldsmith easily agreed to. He could afford to pay this from the interest he charged to his lenders, still maintaining a small profit. Matters subsided and the goldsmith became dissatisfied with the measly amounts of profits he was making. Trade was increasing, and so were the demands for increased credits, but our goldsmith, or rather banker now, had only a limited amount of gold to lend. He then came across an even better idea — he would let out more paper money than he had actual gold. In this way he could profit from an even larger interest sum, from gold that did not even exist. And since no-one knew how much gold was in his vault but himself, this sounded like a foolproof plan. Once again, the goldsmiths ostentatious wealth triggered suspicions, and people began to claim their gold back. More and more people flocked to the goldsmith as these suspicions grew large. And then there came a time when the goldsmith did not have enough gold to pay back. The ‘bank’ was run on and people lost faith in this system. Even so, since increase of trade was so important, governments began legalizing this process of creating money out of debt, and imposed restrictions on the ratio of real to fake money, also known as the ‘Fractional Reserve System’. In case of run ons, a so called Central Bank provided emergency access to gold. Naturally, if there were too many run ons, the system could thus crash.\nCut to the modern world, this is no longer the case. The enormous amounts of debts prevalent today has shrunk the gold to money ratio to almost zero. So now instead of representing value, money represents debt. Also the previously existing bank checks, or paper money were a pledge for actual gold. But now a paper banknote can only be exchanged for another paper banknote and no such obligation exists. As more debt means X times more money for the bank to lend, banks encourage credit spending. The interests paid by the poor who cannot afford the required amenities for life, and thus rely on loans from banks, go to the rich depositors making them richer. Thus the ever widening gap in our social strata. But if this was not enough, the evils of the monetary system are far more pronounced and are becoming more rampant by the day.\nTechnological Unemployment\nNearly all major social changes in society can be attributed to technological advancements. With the technology that we have today it is possible to feed, clothe and provide shelter to all of people in the planet. And not just that, we can in fact thrive with a high standard of living for all of us. How is this possible? By fixing the problems of distribution. It is not hard to see that machines are able to produce more than what is needed in all spheres, and are consistently improving performance. The only problem is the distribution which is really really screwed up because of our current system. Technological progress has made the use of human labor obsolete. Machines are better, faster and more precise as opposed to human labor. Moreover, they do not need to be paid salaries, or provided vacations. Hence, they are but the only meaningful way for an industry to survive and be competitive. The bottom-line is technology cannot be neglected. But what is the impact of this? More and more human jobs are being replaced by machines. The coming up of new jobs is only an illusion, the number of jobs being entirely replaced is always far greater. This is resulting in increased unemployment, and even so, when the supply is potentially infinite, the common people have no purchasing power, as there is no income!\nInfinite Growth Paradigm and Planned Obsolescence\nOur current economy is based on an infinite growth paradigm while we all live in a finite planet with finite resources. This is another potentially harmful characteristic in an economy, whose primary motive should be to economize. Because we need to keep up with the increasing supply, there is a need for a false demand. Hence we see companies sometimes spending more than 50% of their product cost on advertising (more than on the product itself!) — creating a false sense of need for something which might be otherwise, completely useless.\nAlso another repercussion of this current system is that the goods which are procured from the market are inherently inferior in quality, to keep up with the false costs of advertising, marketing and the like, and also to maintain a significant profit margin. This gives rise to a completely absurd phenomenon — Planned Obsolescence — whereby goods are produced in such a way that they intrinsically break down after a certain period of use, to keep up with the infinite growth aspect. Thus leading to increasing waste of rare minerals, pollution and depletion of natural resources as seen in so many places in the world today.\nIncrease in competition leads to greater social evils\nComing from a hugely competitive background, I can see why competition can be so evil. The increase in the competitive nature of society in all spheres has led to a series of hugely deteriorating subcultures. Education now has become a means to earn money via a well paying job, rather than actual study and research on the subject matter itself. The values attributed to success and wealth are so large in today’s times that they have almost entirely replaced the good old value systems of humanity, trust and goodness. The quest for hoarding enormous amounts of wealth and the increasing need for ‘ownership’, has led to rampant corruption in many major nations. This results in an increase in inequality within people and nations, leading to several money related crimes like theft, extortions and kidnappings. War has become an industry with billions of dollars worth of resources spent on defense every year in nearly all of the major nations, while a a seventh of the world’s population lives in poverty and starvation. Also the nature of competition makes most people end up in jobs they do not wish to do, but do just for the sake of ‘earning a living’, thus leading to diseases like stress, anxiety and depression — affecting entire cultures. And due to the nature of epigenetic effects these harmful psychosocial phenomenon make their way into the next generations.\nAlternative strategies for the future\nFuturists like Buckminster Fuller and Jacque Fresco have surmised that the world is now capable of forming a sustainable economy for the entire planet as a whole. There are enough untapped power possibilities like solar, wind, geothermal, tidal and wave — which are held from being utilized, by the ‘influential industries’ responsible for hydrocarbon power generation today (Leading to the string of Oil wars in history). Technologies like 3D printing can be used to print anything from machines to clothes and in the near future could very well replace the entire manual construction process in housing. Soil-less farming techniques like Hydroponics and Aquaponics using vertical clusters can more than eliminate the world’s need for food. The number of advanced technologies useful for such a sustainable society are plenty and growing. But for such a system, the entire world must come together, erase all borders and create a one world economy where all of the earth’s people own all of the earth’s resources. This may sound far-fetched. But is really necessary. And perhaps might be the only solution to the current crisis grappling the world today. ‘The Venus Project’ put forward by Jacque Fresco is one such idea where the government is formed by intelligent computer systems which trigger actions based on the availability of earthly resources, unlike opinionated judgements in today’s governments. This sort of technological anarchy is not biased by any culture, religion or race and instead treats the entire earth as one home. Technology is embraced in this system, and only the best possible goods are produced and made available via ‘access points’ — sort of like libraries as they exist today. State of the art housing and food, is provided using sustainable energy sources. Thus with all goods and services made available, there is no need for money in this system. This will signal an end to mundane jobs, which will be replaced by machines. Also to jobs which serve no useful purpose for the progress of humanity (Unfortunately, a majority of us are employed in such jobs today — like banking, finance, advertising, marketing, sales, law etc.) Only work which require original human thought would exist. While a small fraction of the total population is needed to volunteer for this, the rest can actively participate in work that they like to do, resulting in an increased productivity and far superior output in all spheres. All research would be open sourced and shared for everyone to enjoy a high quality of living, putting an end to inequality and all the plethora of crimes which result from it. Such an economy which operates based on the available earthly resources, with sustainability and preservation at its core, taking care of the entire human population at a high standard of living is termed by Jacque Fresco, aptly, as a Resource Based Economy (or RBE in short). The RBE unlike any economic system in the past, has never been realized before, hence it is hard to grasp at first, the feasibility of it. But owing to the technological age that we live in today, such a system is very possible.\nMany a question has been raised as to how such a world can be brought about. It doesn’t seem humanly possible at present. With rampant corruption and cut throat competition everywhere, it seems hardly likely that people would protest all together at the same time to overthrow entire governments. Some semblance of an uprising could be seen in the Occupy Wall Street protests in the US, and the ‘No Capitalism’ protests in Europe. But the majority of the people are still ignorant as to how the system works, most have lost hope in it, and continue being victims of its workings, trying their very best to somehow rise above the rest and survive. If only they knew, that the world has reached a stage that there is no longer any need to fight amongst oneselves and that there’s enough for everyone!\nThe transition\nSo we arrive at action. What shall we do now? Even if we know what is wrong, how can we go about changing it? To quote Buckminster Fuller : “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” Hence we must ourselves move in the direction of sharing and sustainability. And if we look closely, the world is somehow already going in that direction. Car pooling services (mitfahrgelegenheit.de is one example in Germany) where the person driving a car, most often takes along 2–3 complete strangers along for the ride, whenever s/he is driving long distances. The fare is not intended to make profit but is just enough to pay for the fuel required during the trip. But is certainly less than what one would normally be charged in a train. This is a win-win situation for all, not to mention, a possibly great conversation and the cultural awareness that it lends. This feature is yet to be seen in developing countries (rather, countries with great inequality amongst masses), owing to a lack of trust more than anything else. In such countries, monetary related crimes contribute the most to this lack of trust. Another example seen in more equal countries is the concept of free room sharing (couchsurfing.org is an example which is used by people across the world), where one person provides his/her place for visitors to occupy for free whenever they are visiting the town/city they live in. The host can in turn, if they want, do the same when they travel to the visitors’ city/country. This is also something based completely on trust and humane principles, again owing to and resulting from, a rich cultural awareness. And once again, monetary related crimes and lack of trust resulting from them, acts as a deterrent to such intercultural exchanges. Another great example of how sharing resources can lead to things unimaginable otherwise — Coursera.org is an online education portal which enables anyone in the world to enrol for courses they want to study, taught by professors from some of the best universities in the world. Unlike other online courses, these courses are completely free and have a slated start and end time period like in a normal university. The responses to this initiative have been astounding as was presented in founder Daphne Koller’s TED talk : “What we’re learning from online education”. From what it seems this is only the beginning.\nFrom a very inspired talk by Oscar Gonzalez of ‘The Zeitgeist Movement’ (another world organisation which aims to educate people and thus bring about a sustainable economy like the RBE) titled : Transition to a Resource Based Economy, I learnt how the transition process would look like. Imagine the old video cassette players which we used before the CD players came out. The video cassettes were bulky and hard to deal with. Video quality was also, often poor. And then after the advent of the CD player (again thanks to Science) people began to have both CDs and cassettes at homes, some old movies for which CDs were not usually available had to be watched using cassettes. And slowly CDs entirely replaced the cassettes. To draw an analogy, we all presently do have a small resource based economy of our own. This small circle perhaps include our parents, spouses, kids, relatives and close friends. Within this circle, for some small help, within our available resources (knowledge, money, time) we do not usually charge a fee. For example I do not charge a service fee to my mother when she asks me to get the groceries. While this small circle exists in harmony, the entire outer world becomes the real world economy, where nearly all relationships run on monetary ties. Like, for example, to order a beetroot in a Chilean village, I would hand over the slated price of the beetroot and have the beetroot in return. The way the transition has to move forward, is for our small resource based circle to expand and the large monetary based circle to contract. This can be achieved via many ways, by forming small sustainable groups for example, like in a village or small town, who have the same ideals and promise to work together. Education is a must in this regard, and that more and more people know what the problem is, and identify possible solutions to it.\nMarcin Jakubowski’s project ‘Open Source Ecology’ aims to do something similar. Bringing together a network of farmers, engineers and supporters, Open Source Ecology, or OSE aims to eventually build the ‘Global Village Construction Set’ (GVCS) — a set of 50 machines which would enable a small group to build a sustainable village/town with modern comforts. The idea is to make the blueprint for these machines ‘Open Source’ — a term used in the software world as openly available source code for anyone to read, use or replicate — for free. Thus with the advent of such groups, and machines, people from all over the world can make use of freely available technology to equip themselves to survive in a sustainable way, without the help of any outside help or support. These communities can only be expected to grow when more and more people see the benefits of living in such societies. And soon we would be able to witness the first futuristic city as proposed in The Venus Project.\nPerhaps this is still very distant, but with increased awareness, this time could come sooner than one can expect. Just that with issues like the ‘Global Economic Collapse’ looming large, let’s just hope that the world transitions into something better in a peaceful way rather than killings and wars which would, very certainly, render it unsuitable for living. Or worse, even destroy itself.\nOriginally published at http://milspeak.wordpress.com.\n","id":"https://hsaikia.github.io/post-monetary-economics/","title":"The transition to a sustainable future post monetary economics."},"https://hsaikia.github.io/the-haunted-house/":{"body":"I do not understand them\nWhy they ostracize my home\nThe house that I live in\nAnd been living for quite sometime\nFriends I have few (But who has friends in the city anyways?!)\nWas a loner as long as I can recollect\nAll day I sit on my desk and scribble\nAt nights on life I retrospect\nThey called the house haunted\nThis very house that I live in\n(Maybe they saw the cobwebs in the basement\nLittle realising the art within!)\nI do not hear them, let alone see\nThe spirits that supposedly reside with me\nBut one night on the attic while I was scribbling\nA story about a lonely writer\nI heard a slight sound – a knock\nOf the door closing, creaking tighter\nI climbed down the stairs\nCarefully tip-toed\nSaw a woman in a white gown\nBlonde locks hanging down\nYes, she has to be the one\nThe ghost at last I found!\nTerrified at first, I was stuck in painless silence\nUnending, unforgiving, my feet were numb\nCrouched on the stairs, heart in mouth, knowing not\nWhether to run, or scream aloud!\nThen came a second knock\nWho could it be now?\nIt’s been long since I had a visitor\nWere there more of them now?\nThe saintly spirit answered the door\nAnd in came a man from the other world\nTogether they seemed to smilingly whisper\n\"There is no-one, we are alone...\"\nShocked out of my wits\nMy life was at stake\nMoving back I stumbled on the vase\nA shattering sound it did make\nThey shrieked, and shouted \"Who’s there?\"\nAnd that was when I rose up in fright\nThe woman screamed, the man grabbed her\nThey both bolted out of sight\nAs they ran, Jon cried out loud\nAnd Matilda nodded in too\n\"What they said was true, my dear\n...what they said was true!\"\n\nComments\n\n\nAshish Anand (on August 8, 2008) : Witty in a very peculiar way. Apparently, the poem gives an idea about Saikia’s current state of mind. Nice one Saikia. Keep posting more poems 🙂\n\n\nIpchita Bharali (on August 9, 2008) : A very amusing one again.. kind of reminds me of the movie \"The Others\" but it has its own uniqueness.. i must visit your blog more often for these delightful treats 🙂\n\n\nHimangshu Saikia (on August 11, 2008) : Well, I forgot to mention my inspiration for this one! Indeed it was influenced by my dear friend Anubhaw's description of \"The Others\" (but he didn't mention the name of the movie at that time), as well as the exquisite (read: \"jaw-dropping\") ending of \"The Sixth Sense\" which remains etched in my mind till today 🙂\n\n\nArpit Garg (on December 11, 2008) : Nice one Saikia da!\n\n\nSarang Sharma (on March 17, 2009) : Haha... Cool poem man... \"The Others\" to yaad aayi sahi mein... But I also remembered a joke -:\nGhost1 (to ghost2) – Have you seen that human who lives above?\nGhost2 – Rubbish. There is no such thing as a human. 🙂\n\n\nMaharnab Hazarika (aka Maya Butler) (on January 21, 2012) : Never could write anything ghostly or haunted.

This was always the case, though in the present time it is accentuated by social media. Users of social media are exposed only to targeted posts, articles and news - depending upon their location, their ideological standing, cultural upbringing, religious and political affiliations and other personal factors — factors which are tracked via their usage patterns, page visits, likes and dislikes etc. This targeted campaign which initially started as a harmless means of increasing ad revenue, has perhaps unexpectedly, unleashed a sleeping giant — mass human conditioning.\nHumans are highly programmable. Most of our likes, dislikes, eating habits, preferences for clothing, the media that we like to consume, most of it is just due to our conditioning. So goes the saying : You are free to make your own choices, but your choices are made for you.\nHence, in this day and age, where billions of people are increasingly being conditioned by social media using their own conformation biases — it is important to understand whether the ideologies (political or otherwise) that we believe in, have the characteristics to stand the test of time.\nConsider, the ideology X — which is not against any other ideology, and accepts the fact that multiple ideologies can coexist peacefully. Ideology Y on the other hand, is considered the best possible ideology, one which is better than all others, and have very little chances of evolving into something better.\nHere are certain resultant characteristics that can be observed in followers of the two ideologies :\nUniversal Acceptance or the reaching of a conclusion\nFor followers of ideology X, always reaching a conclusion is unimportant, there need not be any universal acceptance, they can all agree to disagree and be content with no clear answer. This usually leads to slower but more peaceful progress.\nFollowers of Ideology Y, on the other hand, must always reach a conclusion, because a vague or inconclusive result is untenable. It’s either 0 or 1, nothing can be in between. This leads to rapid progress but could result in vehement oppositions and/or violent suppressions.\nUniversal Tolerance or accepting opinions that do not make perfect sense\nFollowers of ideology X always showcase universal tolerance, all opinions are heard and sympathized with. A majority opinion is of course considered to move forward, but minority opinions — unpopular ones too — are allowed to exist, and even thrive. Here, everyone is always open to new ideas from anywhere — whether they be functional or not.\nFollowers of ideology Y do not showcase universal tolerance. The best way forward, should ideally be the opinion of the majority. Unpopular opinions are looked down upon, or even promptly crushed.\nReceptivity to change or the ability to keep evolving\nSince all ideas have prominence in ideology X, it has the ability to continuously change and adapt to new ideas over time, assimilating within itself, all of the good ideas of the past and present, without any attachment to ideas of one particular era.\nIdeology Y, which is not receptive to other ideas, can only grow very slowly, and even then, perhaps sub-optimally. It can easily be taken over by other ideologies which become popular, or work better in the present age, as knowledge widens in the global society.\nStrength in Diversity\nIdeology X finds more strength as its followers grow more diverse, as it can gain from ideas and opinions from multiple different angles. Evolution and growth is certainly very slow in this case, since quick implementations are needed for rapid growth. However, this kind of growth is more sustainable and consistent in the long run.\nDiversity is a nightmare for followers of Ideology Y, since more varied opinions result in greater difficulty in arriving at conclusions. These societies usually grow very fast, due to their homogeneous nature of thoughts and opinions, and as such, are hampered greatly by differing opinions.\nEase of comparing similarities vs differences\nSince many different ideas exist within the X ecosystem, it is easier to look at similarities rather than differences, and feel positive. Suboptimal (read : bad) strategies need not be removed, they are just replaced by better and newer strategies and naturally made obsolete as a result. Thus, the focus is on addition.\nWithin Y, it is much easier to notice difference rather than similarities, since the differing opinion sticks out like a sore thumb. Differing opinions are easier to toss out as opposed to being replaced naturally with time. This may again, lead to violence.\n(Meta) Conclusion\nFrom all of the above characteristics, it can be said that followers of X can incorporate followers of Y in their societal fabric easily. However followers of Y would find it extremely difficult to incorporate those of X or from another similar ideology Y* into theirs. Hence, X can be said to be the universal ideology which can stand the test of time, as it will assimilate all Y ideologies into it and coexist within the same eco-system. It is time all of us tried to understand this and ask ourselves, whether the ideologies that we love and support and identify with, have the characteristics of X or Y. Perhaps we would get more clarity from this self-introspection and can have better control over our consistent social conditioning.\n","id":"https://hsaikia.github.io/universal-ideology/","title":"The universal ideology"}},"docInfo":{"https://hsaikia.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://hsaikia.github.io/a-face-in-the-dark/":{"body":405,"title":2},"https://hsaikia.github.io/about/":{"body":85,"title":0},"https://hsaikia.github.io/agricola-ai/":{"body":931,"title":6},"https://hsaikia.github.io/archive/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://hsaikia.github.io/das-leben-ist-schoen/":{"body":81,"title":4},"https://hsaikia.github.io/eco-village/":{"body":1819,"title":8},"https://hsaikia.github.io/effort-additive-not-subtractive/":{"body":644,"title":3},"https://hsaikia.github.io/french-tarrasch/":{"body":426,"title":4},"https://hsaikia.github.io/icpc-asia-regionals/":{"body":411,"title":4},"https://hsaikia.github.io/love-is-in-the-air/":{"body":390,"title":2},"https://hsaikia.github.io/modern-day-holocaust/":{"body":1639,"title":7},"https://hsaikia.github.io/my-best-game-ever/":{"body":709,"title":2},"https://hsaikia.github.io/my-life/":{"body":543,"title":1},"https://hsaikia.github.io/perception-intelligence/":{"body":596,"title":4},"https://hsaikia.github.io/post-monetary-economics/":{"body":1794,"title":6},"https://hsaikia.github.io/the-haunted-house/":{"body":285,"title":2},"https://hsaikia.github.io/universal-ideology/":{"body":511,"title":2}},"length":18},"lang":"English"};
