  <h1><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hsaikia.github.io&#x2F;love-is-in-the-air&#x2F;">Love is in the air</a></h1>
  
  <div class="post-content"><p>There was a hill far away<br />
On top of which a meadow lay<br />
A lonesome flower bloomed at sight<br />
Toughodil was her name<br />
Amidst strong winds and pouring rain at night<br />
She shone like a handsome jewel, bright</p>
<p>There was a happy honey-bee<br />
From where he came, no one could see<br />
He sung his worries away all day<br />
They called him little Wanderbee<br />
Seeing things, going places<br />
With buzzing wings and endless glee</p>
<p>It was early spring one day<br />
Wanderbee flew up the hill<br />
Rested in the shade of Toughodil<br />
Her fragrance was so enticing<br />
Her honey was so sweet!<br />
All day long with great relish he passed<br />
When he was set to leave she said:<br />
&quot;Do you remember my name, Wander bee??..<br />
I told you last time you came..&quot;<br />
&quot;I do not remember anything..<br />
not even this taste of honey<br />
but may I know your name please<br />
if you so persist?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Tis Toughodil, from far away hill<br />
I hope you come again..&quot;</p>
<p>Like the hearts of joyous souls ring<br />
Like the happiness ocean tides bring<br />
Love is in the air they sing<br />
Love is in the air ~ ~ ~</p>
<p>And it was soon summer<br />
And Toughodil's shade still softer<br />
Out of the worldly worries<br />
Away from the heat<br />
Wanderbee closed his eyes<br />
While smiling in his dreams.<br />
When he was set to leave she said:<br />
&quot;Do you remember my name, Wander bee??..<br />
I told you last time you came..&quot;<br />
&quot;I do not remember anything..<br />
not even this taste of honey<br />
but may I know your name please<br />
if you so persist?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Tis Toughodil, from far away hill<br />
I hope you come again..&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly there was autumn<br />
Leaves started to fade<br />
But Toughodil as tough can be<br />
Continued to bloom away<br />
As Wanderbee entered his safe refuge<br />
Her honey was life, her fragrance hope<br />
Thought he, no matter what time of the year<br />
I could live in this place forever!<br />
When it was time to leave she said:<br />
&quot;Do you remember my name, Wander bee??..<br />
I told you last time you came..&quot;<br />
&quot;I do not remember anything..<br />
not even this taste of honey<br />
but may I know your name please<br />
if you so persist?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;'Tis Toughodil, from far away hill<br />
I hope you come again..&quot;</p>
<p>All this time, every day<br />
Wanderbee in his comfy home<br />
Thought about Toughodil<br />
To his fellow bee-friends<br />
he narrated his story:<br />
&quot;There is a flower on far away hill<br />
Goes by the name of Toughodil<br />
Her sight is like a hallowed angel<br />
Her taste a fountain of life!<br />
For ages I have loved her<br />
But am too scared to confess<br />
I do not know how she feels for me<br />
What if I lose all I have!&quot;</p>
<p>Like the hearts of joyous souls ring<br />
Like the happiness ocean tides bring<br />
Love is in the air they sing<br />
Love is in the air ~ ~ ~</p>
<p>And along came the torrid winter<br />
Animals ran here and there for shelter<br />
Everything was white and on snowy hold<br />
And Wanderbee was freezing cold<br />
In his way up far away hill</p>
<p>There he was shocked in nothingness<br />
Toughodil seemed not as tough anymore<br />
Faded and colourless she lied<br />
The cold was too strong for her might!<br />
There was no fragrance anymore<br />
The honey had dried!<br />
Wanderbee could not believe his life<br />
Had taken quite a turn<br />
Feeble and weak he lied on the snow<br />
And closed his eyes again<br />
The wind seemed to whisper<br />
He understood what it meant:</p>
<p>&quot;You do not remember my name, Wander bee..<br />
Though I told you last time you came..<br />
There is something else which I needed to say<br />
But it is now too late</p>
<p>I adored your little flapping wings<br />
The simple songs you sung<br />
Your smile (while you slept) was everything to me<br />
Your love, I longed for so long!&quot;</p>
<p>Wanderbee now smiled as he faded<br />
Being buried in snow he slowly said:<br />
&quot;Death took you away dear Toughodil<br />
I was late, I was wrong in my ways<br />
But there is something which I can do (even now)<br />
I'll lie here and wait for you..</p>
<p>My love.. I'll lie here and wait for y-o-u...&quot;</p>
<p>Like the hearts of joyous souls ring<br />
Like the happiness ocean tides bring<br />
Love is in the air they sing<br />
Love is in the air ~ ~ ~</p>
