  <div class="post-content"><p>This was one story which had always enthralled me as a kid, to put it into poetry wasn't that difficult. I hope it still preserves a part of Ruskin Bond's magic with storytelling ðŸ™‚</p>
<hr />
<p>I was a teacher in a small town<br />
I was kind and giving<br />
Spent my time with simple children<br />
Teaching virtue and truthful living<br />
&quot;Always believe what is seen by your eyes<br />
Or heard by your own ears<br />
'Cause a rumour spreads faster than light<br />
And confusion is all it smears..&quot;</p>
<p>Villagers there were many<br />
Part of a superstitious lot<br />
No matter what reasoning provided<br />
Fear still lurked in their hearts<br />
The children simple beings they were<br />
Feared the paranormal too<br />
Scared of the graveyard that lied on the outskirts<br />
Made a point to avoid that route<br />
That led right through to school<br />
And was haunted by spirits and ghouls</p>
<p>One day the sun went down sooner<br />
And it had grown quite dark<br />
I had to walk my way back home<br />
All the way down the long path<br />
But there was this route through the graveyard<br />
That was 'haunted' yet was short<br />
Ghosts and spirits are all in our minds<br />
Thinking to myself I laughed<br />
While starting to walk that path<br />
Firmly my beliefs I held.</p>
<p>As it grew spookier<br />
Strange sounds seemed to howl<br />
In the darkness lurking shadows<br />
Seem to move and prowl<br />
My heart was pumping hard<br />
A strange feeling surrounded the air<br />
As if someone's creeping up from behind<br />
Or was it just my mind?<br />
Daringly I walked on<br />
Every step in two minds I took,<br />
Hoping to find my way, with limbs that shook<br />
Telling myself every moment<br />
Not once behind must I look</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice was heard<br />
It grew distinct slowly<br />
A voice seemed to wince<br />
And seemed to weep<br />
It was a girl behind a tree<br />
Face hidden in her knees<br />
An enormous pain seemed to shroud her<br />
Knowing not what it was<br />
I walked right upto her and asked<br />
&quot;What happened, little girl?&quot;</p>
<p>She would not lift her head up for me<br />
No matter how I persist<br />
At length when I bended down to see<br />
A horrifying sight awaited me<br />
There was no face<br />
No eyes, no nose, no lips<br />
A face as blank and pale<br />
As a sheet of paper<br />
Gleaming in the moonlight<br />
Staring fixedly at me..</p>
<p>I took to my heels<br />
As fast as I could<br />
I let my legs run free<br />
In disbelief of what I'd seen</p>
<p>Everything was hazy to me<br />
As I was running out of breath<br />
A glimmer of light came as hope<br />
At the deep end of the road I could see<br />
Someone holding a lantern low<br />
As I neared and stopped to breathe<br />
The man came close to be<br />
&quot;What happened Sir, how come you're here?&quot;<br />
He inquired in a tone of strange monotony</p>
<p>I huffed and puffed and cried out loud<br />
&quot;There's a girl without a face..&quot;<br />
&quot;She had no eyes, no nose nor lips..&quot;<br />
&quot;She ought to be a ghost..!&quot;<br />
Calmed down the chowkidar at my story<br />
And came closer still<br />
Held up the lantern high enough<br />
And said these words slowly<br />
&quot;Do you mean it was like this.... Sir?&quot;<br />
And I stared in disbelief<br />
A man without a face.. again<br />
Seemed smiling straight at me..</p>
<p>A gutsy stroke of wind came down<br />
Someone heard a shout<br />
As silence took over everything<br />
And blew the lantern out...</p>

<p><strong>Santanu Baishya</strong> (on November 28, 2007) : Witnessing all truth might not bring fortune always...we should do go for scientific reasons but at the same time should stay careful of the odds too....because in this world there are facts that we still don't know, or yet to know...anyway, it was horrifying...hehe.</p>

<p><strong>Himangshu Saikia</strong> (on November 28, 2007) : AFAIK, Ruskin Bond is no scientist! So he made it look so true (still am unsure about spirits) And the character here just didn't believe in ghosts, he didn't try to reveal the truth about them or anything.. seems like he was unsure about his own beliefs.</p>
